# Threat Data Analysis (Post-Standardization)

**Total threats: 775**

This document reflects the state of `threats.json` after standardization work was performed to condense identical and near-identical abilities and bonuses. The standardization replaced threat-specific names with "this Threat", unified punctuation/capitalization, resolved cross-references (e.g., "See Navis Armsman"), and split compound entries (e.g., BESTIAL RAIDERS Fellgor sub-bonuses, Mark of Chaos variants, CONTAGION variants) into separate named entries.

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Bonuses | Abilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Identical** | 136 names | 141 names |
| **Similar** | 65 names | 128 names |
| **Total multi-threat names** | 201 names | 269 names |

### Standardization Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identical Bonuses | 74 | 136 | +62 |
| Similar Bonuses | 104 | 65 | -39 |
| Identical Abilities | 89 | 141 | +52 |
| Similar Abilities | 120 | 128 | +8 |

Note: Ability "Similar" count increased slightly because standardization consolidated some previously-unique entries into shared names (e.g., splitting compound entries created new multi-threat groups). The total number of "similar" entries that are genuinely problematic near-duplicates decreased significantly. Many entries in the Similar Abilities list are intentionally different (different DN values, dice amounts, or fundamentally different mechanics under the same name).
