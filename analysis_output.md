## Similar Bonuses (108 names)

These bonuses share the same name but differ in minor ways: different numbers (e.g., different Ruin amounts), threat-specific name swaps in an otherwise identical template, minor punctuation/capitalization differences, or page reference additions.

### Champion (214 threats, 56 variants)

This is by far the most common varying bonus. The template is \"This Threat may use/take Ruin Actions and has N personal Ruin.\" Variations come from:
- Different Ruin amounts (1 through 13)
- Capitalization differences (\"Ruin Actions\" vs \"Ruin actions\", \"Personal Ruin\" vs \"personal Ruin\")
- \"use\" vs \"take\"
- Some use \"This Threat\" while others use the threat's specific name (e.g., \"The Avatar may use...\", \"A Farseer may use...\")
- Some include additional clauses (e.g., Autarch adds \"They may activate the Move Ruin Action during their own turn\")

Key variant groups:
- **3 personal Ruin** (13 threats): TACTICAL SPACE MARINE, ORK NOB, PAINBOY, SUCCUBUS, HAEMONCULUS, MEGANOB, MORKANAUT, GORKANAUT, OVERLORD, XV95 GHOSTKEEL BATTLESUIT SHAS'VRE, KROOT SHAPER, MASQUE OF SLAANESH, TORMENTBRINGER

- **9 personal Ruin** (1 threat): IMOTEKH THE STORMLORD
- **13 personal Ruin** (1 threat): ABADDON THE DESPOILER

The \"take\" vs \"use\" wording split generally follows source book origin (Threat Assessment Xenos uses \"take\", others use \"use\").

## Summary Statistics

| **Similar** | 108 names | 120 names |

The most prolific shared bonus is **Champion** (214+ threats across both casings), and the most prolific shared ability is **Daemonic Aura** (47 threats). The overwhelming majority of \"varying\" entries are **Similar** rather than truly Overlapping -- most differences come from inserting specific threat names into an otherwise identical template, differing Ruin/dice amounts, page reference inclusion, or punctuation/capitalization differences between source books.
