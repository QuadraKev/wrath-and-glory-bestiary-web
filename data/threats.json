    "description": "The unwashed trillions that form Imperial society and prop up the Emperor's war machine through sweat and blood are diverse beyond imagining, hailing from the million unique worlds that make up the Imperium. However, there are some commonalities between the downtrodden commoners: they are utterly devoted to the God-Emperor, and ignorant of anything beyond the propaganda they are fed. They labour in hazardous conditions for punishing hours, and their treacherous work has left them with missing body parts replaced with cheap augmetics.\n\nEvangeline Galdain is a typical citizen, working for 18 hours every day at a plascrete manufactorum in Hive Ultio on Gilead Primus. She lost her organic leg when an overtired co-worker fumbled with a Heavy Rock Crusher. Her eye was replaced after a blight of Rector's Rot swept through her hab block; all she can remember from the incident that broke her ocular augmetic is the smell of incense, and she refuses to repair it or check the recordings.\n\nEvangeline spends her few spare credits on holy writs of protection sold by the Ecclesiarchy, though she can barely read the High Gothic script — even so, she has noticed some disquieting errors, which she has written off as mistranslations on her part.\n\nIf an Imperial Citizen is encountered during or after their work for the day, they are more than likely Exhausted.",

Equipped with sturdy armour and deadly weaponry, these agents discipline, capture, and execute those who go against the authorities' proclamations. More often than not, Enforcers are an extension of the planetary governor's will, empowered to arrest and detain with even the flimsiest excuse.\n\nEnforcers are arrogant and believe themselves above the law. They are cunning enough to cover their corrupt activities (or their employer's), but will not hesitate to use whatever means necessary to enforce their governor's laws, bringing Shock Maul and Shotgun to bear. Without sufficient leverage they are difficult to sway from their tasks, but many have rackets on the side in case their governor suddenly turns up dead. Enforcers are usually most dangerous when directed by a commander, but if they take it upon themselves to mete out some rough justice, they can be an intimidating force on their own. Characters should certainly think before killing an Enforcer, lest they bring down the full weight of planetary law upon their heads.",

A clock in their nervous system constantly ticks down to their death, only reset through the act of killing. Some are criminals sentenced to 'death by Chrono', while others are victims of enslavement, or unfortunate debtors who give their lives to settle their account.\n\nFew escape the toll their gross augmentation takes on their sanity. Those that are able to make their peace with their new life rise to new heights of power as bodyguards and assassins. Others are warped in both mind and body: the Timekeeper of Hive Testimonium on Gilead Primus marks their kills with the precise time of death daubed on the walls above their victims, sustaining decades of life through bursts of violence.\n\nChronos are physically powerful, with augmentations such as oversized hydraulic claws, buzz-saw arms, iron lungs and piston-driven legs. Most have subdermal armour and chemically-induced resistance to pain. A Chrono's behaviour depends on how much of their humanity they retain — some protect fragile lives outside their bloody business. Others have lost themselves to a red rage, immune to reason or compassion. All of them know it is only a matter of time, and may attack allies when their precious seconds are running slim. Chrono Gladiators are a terrifying foe to throw against characters, whether fighting for their lives in a Scum Pit or hunting them down through the chaotic corridors of a Hive.",

They are perfectly adapted to their purpose, whether as a living weapon, a technical toolkit, or a portable cogitator. While the Human components of some Servitors are grown in vats, and others are condemned criminals, some well-connected crime lords and tyrants turn those who have failed them into Servitors. The infamous Commissar Nero Domitius went rogue with a unit of loyal soldiers to avoid investigation into his re-use of troops as illegally-programmed Combat Servitors. Once caught he stated it was so that they could continue to protect the Imperium, even in death.\nMany Servitors have the capacity to speak in binary cant, and some nobles have luxury models that can speak Low Gothic, but all Servitor communication is functional and pre-programmed at best. At worst, the fractured mind of the Human it once was misfires, producing incoherent, unnerving speech patterns. Servitors are all but immune to pain, with reinforced plating hammered into their torsos and armoured mesh wrapping their vital organs. Those marked for death by a Combat Servitor's programming best beware the heavy weapon in place of one arm, aided by the targeting array on the other. More specialised models may have a different weapon instead of an off hand, ranging from fairly standard Heavy Bolters and Power Claws to more dangerous and unstable weapons such as Plasma Cannons. The eyes of most Combat Servitors are replaced with targeting optics that allow them to see in all light conditions. Some are given tracks or mechanical talons rather than legs.\nCombat Servitors are effective in a Mob or under the control of a commander, and are utterly implacable until forcibly stopped, as their programming overrides anything left of their free will.",

    "description": "Servo-Skulls are Human skulls that have been fitted with support systems and an anti-grav motor, usually the sacrificed remains of a terminal favoured servant, or a low-ranking member of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Often seen flitting around laboratories of Tech-Priests, Administratum archives, and along the trenches of battlefields on the fringes of Imperial space, their small size and manoeuvrability allow them to enter otherwise inaccessible spaces or hazardous areas, as well as the ability to act as additional ‘eyes and ears' for their masters. The Adeptus Mechanicus regard these creations as excellent servants, and their Machine Spirits as exceptionally faithful and pure. Some Inquisitors use Servo-Skulls as a proxy for their own senses. It is rumoured that Inquisitor Lucetta Gargreve invested parts of her consciousness in a specially-customised Servo-Skull, but such an act would be heresy; after her death, Gargreve's Servo-Skull was never found.\nServo-Skulls are capable of communication but their Machine Spirits are rudimentary, only able to provide information drawn from their data banks. Most Servo-Skulls possess a variety of useful devices: a Vox system, Illuminator, Ident Scanner, a Pict-Relay, and Cogitator link to its master. Some are optimised for a specific purpose, possessing a built-in Medicae Diagnostor, Laud Hailer, or Multi-Tool. Dissector Skulls have a disturbing selection of sharp Monoscalpels, while Gun-Skulls possess a pistol-sized weapon wielded with machined accuracy.\nServo-Skulls are difficult to hit due to their small size, and are most likely to be the scout or assistant for a larger force.",

    "description": "Mortal beings, particularly Psykers, are vulnerable to possession by Daemons that are unable to manifest independently in the Materium. Daemons take pleasure in encouraging a hubristic mortal's endeavours until the very moment they are forced to turn to the Daemon for aid. While there are common traits in the physical changes wrought by possession, no two cases are alike: they might display discoloured skin that puckers and scabs, a blackening or whitening of the eyes, extra limbs, bone protrusions and even wings. A Possessed Mortal becomes stronger, faster, and more resilient, able to think more quickly as they draw on forbidden knowledge.\nThe more a Possessed succumbs to the Daemon, the more power the Daemon can channel through them. But mortals were not meant to be worn in such a way, and the more control a Daemon exercises, the quicker the host body withers and dies. Each time the mortal taps their power, it edges them closer to their return to the Warp — unless they can find another host. Even if a Daemon returns as a future Threat in a campaign, it will likely be in a different body, as mortals burn bright and briefly.\nDaemonic possession is not subtle. It warps the Possessed Mortal in body, mind, and soul, often manifesting claws, tentacles, and even wings, as well as sporadic regeneration that make it a dangerous, frenzied fighter. Caged in a mortal form, a Daemon's power is much lesser than if it truly manifested, and as such a Possessed Mortal is an intimidating leader at lower and mid Tiers, but most dangerous as a Mob at higher Tiers.",

Treacherous, narcissistic warmongers, they fight for no cause save their own.\nThe corrupting influence of the Warp twists and mutates his ceramite armour, sprouting grotesque growths of bone and glowing daemonic runes. As an Astartes succumbs further to the dark will of the Ruinous Powers, his armour may even fuse with his flesh in a hideous mockery of the Black Carapace. Their weapons, too, are reforged — gun barrels take on the form of leering mouths, and swords become cruel talons. Their frightening visage is a physical manifestation of their traitorous allegiance, adorned with skulls and strips of tattered flesh.\nNo Space Marine's fall is alike. Some simply thirsted for power, giving themselves wholly to the Dark Gods. Some believed Horus to be right, and followed him willingly from the Emperor's light. Others were caught in Warp-storms, left with little choice but to beg the Dark Gods for salvation, and damn themselves in the process.\nMost are ancient, having turned their backs on the Imperium at the dawn of the Horus Heresy, but time moves differently in the Realm of Chaos, the churning currents of the Warp distorting temporal logic. Many Chaos Space Marines emerge into real space having lost only a few moments since the siege of the Emperor's Palace. Others have travelled untold plains, explored vast swathes of the galaxy, and amassed power close to that of a towering Daemon Prince.\nWhatever their past, all Chaos Space Marines are united by one purpose: to see the galaxy consumed by war. They know only hatred, a gnawing hunger for the utter and total destruction of the worlds they once crusaded to save. A Chaos Space Marine makes a truly terrifying Adversary as a lasting enemy — Humanity's corruption given form.",

Daemonettes have androgynous forms, bird-like legs, and pale, near-translucent flesh, with hideous claws and pincers instead of hands. Many seek to lure soldiers from their posts and isolate their enemies with tempting words. Few see a Daemonette and live to tell the tale, but there are those that whisper the sculptor Malchior's unsettling, beautiful statues are inspired by his interaction with a Daemonette. The sources of these whispers invariably find themselves the focus of an Inquisitorial investigation, and are never heard from again.\nDaemonettes are swift, devastating foes. Precise in their savagery, they weave among their enemies to snip off limbs and peel open flesh. Given to the rapture of combat, they savour every wound, killing in the most agonising ways while whispering lies to the dying. Daemonettes confound the strengths of hardened fighters, meaning characters cannot fall back on reliable tactics. Even outside combat, they can attempt to lure characters away and isolate them.",

The Blue Horror splits further into two Brimstones when damaged, tiny Daemons of living Warpfire that burn with hatred and swarm forward to consume their foe. Horrors care nothing for their own safety, gleeful at the prospect of the change their deaths will cause to their forms.

In rare instances, where a Chaos Spawn was once a sorcerer or where its patron god's sadistic humour allows, a Chaos Spawn can exhibit psychic powers. Their bodies shimmer with latent power, burn with ethereal fire, or are wreathed in crackling hoarfrost. These bursts of power go through the same uncontrolled shifts as the rest of a Spawn's existence, not discriminating friend from foe.\nChaos Spawn are rarely coherent enough to lead and are more likely to be isolated encounters or muscle for other Threats.

Armour, for most Orks, consists of iron plates hammered into place across their bodies.\nOrks band together in loose groups called ‘mobs' led by the toughest, meanest Ork, numbering from half a dozen to many hundreds of thousands. Orks are shock troops by nature, running straight into the fray, but this approach makes for poor marksmanship. In fact, few Orks even bother to learn how to reload, referring to the weighty pistols they carry as ‘noise makers' — something to announce their presence before they can introduce their foe to the business end of their Choppa. What they lack in accuracy, however, they make up for with a storm of bullets.\nWhere there is one Ork, there are many, and for those looking to rid themselves of the greenskin menace, a Flamer is highly recommended. Every atom of an Ork must be removed to prevent the spores in its skin releasing and taking root. Orks attack in Mobs, and while their tactics are chaotic, they are also extremely effective.",

To rise through an Ork mob is to be even tougher and more brutal than those clambering for power around you, and Nobz are born to the task. Larger than normal Orks, a Nob's already massive musculature continues to thicken as they grow, as does their appetite for violence. Brawlers by nature, Nobz are always where the fighting is thickest, second only to a Warboss.\nWhile lone Nobz tend to act as crude leaders for the Orks around them, a Warboss often forms his Nobz into a single mob, acting as his personal bodyguard. Crashing into battle wearing a nigh-impregnable suit of Mega Armour equipped with massive mechanical Power Klaws and wrist-mounted Shootas, these Mega Nobz tear through armoured vehicles and fortifications in their rush to get stuck in. Nobz work best when lording it over other Orks, though they are much more likely to charge than hang back behind a wall of Troops.",

Grots are also responsible for making sure an Ork's weapon fires on demand, and often carries said weapon to battle if the Ork has more guns than hands.\nGrots are smart enough to know when to be selfish and may cut deals where Orks would shoot first and ask questions later. They may even be willing to try to persuade their larger brethren to go along with an alliance. Grots have much better eyesight than Orks, which makes them ideal sharpshooters — at least in comparison to the average mob of Boyz.\nThey tend to be armed with archaic guns such as blunderbusses, stub pistols, and whatever else they can loot from the dead.",

The Killa Kans' signature weapon is the Grotzooka, a blunderbuss filled with junk fired at close range to create a spread of high-speed metal that can turn a person into a paste with remarkable efficiency.\nThe Grot pilots of Killa Kans are often chosen for their untapped rage, and their screams of ‘WAAAGH!' as they charge at the nearest tank with a buzzing Drilla can strike fear into the hearts of hardened soldiers. This can have some unfortunate side effects when the power goes to their heads, as evidenced by the rogue unit ‘Lil' Blitza's Gang', a group of Killa Kans who have, somehow, initiated a Grot revolution on a very small scale aboard Persephone's Regret, succeeding in taking a portion of the Hulk for themselves.

These spirits power the colossal Craftworlds with their collected psychic prowess.

Their Spirit Stones are implanted into powerful statuesque constructs formed of psycho-reactive wraithbone. The departed Aeldari souls move these constructs much as the brain moves a body.\nStanding taller even than the Primaris Astartes, the Wraithguard are built for war — strong, durable, and freed of the constraints of biology. In addition to their mighty wraithbone-forged forms and centuries of Aeldari warrior experience, each Wraithguard is equipped with a Wraithcannon; a psychically operated weapon that tears a hole through reality, sucking portions of its unfortunate target into the Immaterium.\nWraithguard view reality through the veil of the Warp, peering through the Immaterium to see the present much as Seers scry the future. Though this allows them to perceive much a mortal cannot, it also leaves them susceptible to the fickle trickery of the Warp's shifting tides.\nCraftworld Ul-Khari rarely summons Wraithguard from their slumber, but their intricate groves of wraithbone are obsessively tended, and many survived the crash on Trollius. The devastated Craftworld has called on its ancestral spirits to defend themselves as many Aeldari died when Ul-Khari was sundered. The tireless Wraithguard stand vigilant throughout the shattered Asuryani craft, eager to enact their vengeance on daemonkind.\nA few Wraithguard operated alongside the Varonius Flotilla, but the effects of the Great Rift on on Wraithsight has impacted their reliability. Rumours of Wraithguard obliterating Sanctioned Psykers and charging invisible foes drove a wedge between the Rogue Trader's camp and the Warlocks of Ul-Khari. Even the Wraithguard stationed on Trollius have been affected, many pausing immobile to stare skyward at the Agri World Ostia for days at a time, as if lost in a trance.",

Most enemies will not know what hit them when a Long Rifle shot finds its mark. Decades, sometimes centuries of exploring the most inhospitable environments and ruined worlds mean that Rangers can move through even the densest terrain as though it were open ground, leaving their prey little hope of escape.\nRangers are often forced to cooperate with those they cross paths with to survive or advance their own agenda and have been known to offer up their services as scouts, trackers, and assassins. Though a Ranger may occasionally accompany a Rogue Trader or Inquisitor, their presence is only ever temporary. A Ranger's only true allegiance is to the Path, and where it calls, they will follow. Like all Eldar, they are agile, swift, and highly intelligent — traits honed by exposure to strange stars and distant planets.",

It is this innate insecurity and fragility of self that leads Corsairs to be far more aggressive, even indirectly, than other Aeldari.\nA Corsair is often found in lavish attire — fine tunics buttoned under flowing jackets or expensive cloaks. Their armour, too, is more decadent than that of other Aeldari with gilded or baroque plates forged into ceremonial battle-suits. Others bare their flesh, asserting their individuality through tattoos, piercings, and ritual scarring. Even a Corsair's weapons are designed to accentuate the persona they embody, while some wield golden Shuriken Pistols and delicate rapiers, others carry wicked blades and toxic Needle weapons.\nAeldari Corsairs work with whoever serves their purposes best, whether other Corsairs with a common goal or mercenaries of other Species who are willing to throw themselves into the fray. Of course, when the going gets tough, such alliances rarely last long.",

    "description": "When a Genestealer is separated from the gestalt Tyranid Hive Mind, its genetic makeup alters. Whether fallen to a world on a chunk of debris from a Space Hulk, or covertly hidden on an Imperial Cruiser, a lone Genestealer relies on an innate set of strange instincts. It creates a lair, then captures living prey, implanting its own unholy genetic material into the host body. Those infected by the ‘Genestealer's Kiss' fall under the dominion of the Patriarch's latent psychic powers — the Broodmind. Connected telepathically, the converted host utterly worships the Genestealer, and sets about bringing others to be ‘converted' by their new god.\nAs the Patriarch's cult grows, so does its power. Its body morphs and enlarges, becoming stronger, faster, and deadlier. Its psychic powers develop, spreading the near-telepathic link between its progeny and gaining new abilities akin to the Maleficarum wielded by Chaos.\nThe Patriarch's brood breeds in secret, sometimes over centuries. The first generation are monstrous fusions of Human and biomorph, but no less holy to the worshippers of the cult — angels standing beside the Patriarch God. As the infestation of the Genestealer spreads and more are brought under its sway, later generations become more and more Human, but none shake the genetic devotion to the Patriarch. These cultists are embedded in every stratum of the local planetary populace, including the manufactorum workforce, government, and military. They sow discord and rebellion against the tyrannical Imperium, bringing more into their accursed fold.\nWhen a Tyranid hive fleet enters an infested system, the Hive Mind asserts itself over the Genestealers and their progeny, using them to throw planetary defenders into disarray and leave the prey world vulnerable to the merciless onslaught of a Tyranid invasion.",

The gruesome murders of citizens in isolated places may be assumed by planetary Enforcers to be the product of some Mutant serial killer or animal, but it is one of the earliest identifiable signs of the Genestealer Infection.\nAs with all Genestealer Cult members, Acolyte Hybrids are completely loyal to their Patriarch and kill for it without question. Given their monstrous shapes and limited intelligence, they cannot assist with the social aspects of the cult's aims, but provide valuable protection for its members, discouraging the curious as well as stalking and kidnapping those they wish to infect.",

They possess Human intelligence linked into the Broodmind, retaining the fierce loyalty of all cult members. Third generation Neophytes retain some alien physiology, with unusual skin pallor or strange cranial formations leading them to cover up wherever possible. Fourth generation Neophytes can integrate well into Imperial society, provided they stay in roles such as manual labourers, where they will not attract scrutiny.\nThese jobs often have the advantage of allowing them access to useful items or methods of sabotage. Tools go missing from locked storage, mining charges are missed from the manifest, and crates of weapons come in lighter than they should. An area of a Hive has to be shut off for decontamination, and it just happens that a nosy Enforcer got trapped inside. Often mistaken for organised crime or petty theft, this sort of activity is a sign of the Genestealer Infection. Across the lifespan of the cult, they amass a stock of weapons, ammo, and explosives for the day when the cult rises and takes the planet.\nCharacters may notice physical traits of an alien nature when interacting with a Neophyte, or they may be evasive about their background or family.

The Patriarch, a purestrain Genestealer who evolves into the controlling heart of the cult, uses the mind of a powerful Psyker to communicate directly with its followers and coordinate the infiltration of the planet.\nA Genestealer Cult Magus is engineered when the cultists infect a Warp-touched Human who then produces this sophisticated hybrid. The Magus acts as the lawgiver and high priest of the cult, as well as a diplomatic weapon to bring influential Humans into line with the cult's aims. An isolated cult usually has one Magus, but as it spreads across the planet, others take responsibility for their own cells in a geographic area, often plotting against one another for greater favour with the Patriarch. A Magus appears as an imposing Human and has immense charisma backed by psychic sway.\nA Genestealer Cult Magus spends years charming influential people and spreading the cult, and for the most part those who interact with them cannot sense their true nature. If a Psyker breaks through their significant defences, they may recoil from the touch of a xenos mind, but in doing so they have made themselves a high priority target for the cult.\nWhen the cult is signalled to reveal its presence, the Magus plays a vital role in directing the uprising. They are likely to send other cult members, such as Hybrid Metamorphs, ahead and then turn the enemy's own minds against them. As their enemies fall to fighting within their own ranks, the Magus directs the cult to swarm the planet's strategic targets, disabling communications and core systems. Even Psykers who attempt to target the cult members find their abilities repelled by the power of the Magus.",

In one hand he wields a monstrous blade, whilst his other drips with streaming red gore, leaving none in doubt that this is the Avatar of the Bloody-Handed God.\n\nThe Avatar of the Ul-Khari Craftworld is perhaps the most dangerous entity in the Gilead System. Even high-Tier Agents may not penetrate the creature's Divine Determination without Combined Fire or dedicated anti-armour weaponry, whilst The Wailing Doom can cause the Annihilation of low-Tier Agents in a single strike. Agents could aim to surround and humble the war god through sheer weight of numbers, but the Avatar is seldom encountered alone, almost always serving as the speartip of the Asuryani warhosts, inspiring his followers to acts of glorious bloodshed.",

Autarchs are identified by their myriad Aspect Warrior wargear, raiment that indicates their personal combat history and preferred blend of strategic philosophies.\n\nAutarchs are devastating fighters in their own right, but are most dangerous when commanding a larger force of Asuryani warriors. As an architect of victory, they effortlessly bait melee-focused Agents to pursue uncatchable foes, whilst bombarding those poor fools with repeated attacks from their army's most devastating weapons. To disrupt this strategy, Agents are advised to eliminate Autarchs as a first priority. Of course, between the Autarch's armour, weapons, and skill at arms, this is easier said than done.",

They use this technology to launch unpredictable surprise attacks, and disappear before facing reprisals. Warp travel is especially dangerous for an Aeldari, as Slaanesh is ever hungry, so for an Aspect Warrior to risk their soul in this manner is regarded by the Asuryani as either foolhardy or courageous. Such valour is unappreciated by the target of a Warp Spider's Death Spinner, as they are entangled in a cloud of monomolecular wire that shreds flesh and bone as it settles.\n\nLike Swooping Hawks, Warp Spiders represent the Asuryani at their most frustratingly elusive. Their hit-and-run tactics target Agents when they are herded into a tight group, so their death spinners can ensnare multiple targets at once. Though Flickerjump allows them to escape melee combat, it can be countered through combined assaults by multiple Agents.",

This daunting spectacle is accompanied by the lightning discharge of Shadow Spectre prism rifles, the spectral bands of the laser shot fine-tuned to target large groups or priority targets as required. By attuning to a bizarre crystal targeting matrix known as the Ghostlight, the Aspect Warriors can even combine the shots of multiple prisms rifles into a single lancing strike, that punches through tank armour with ease.\n\nShadow Spectres combine the deadly weaponry of Dark Reapers with the mobility of Swooping Hawks, claiming their enemy's souls whilst remaining out of range from return fire. They are easily scattered by Agents with heavy weapons though, or canny melee combatants who find a way to close the gap with stealth or speed. Fortunately, Shadow Spectres are commonly deployed alongside Ghost Warriors, whose resilience and horrifying short-range firepower effectively compliments these weaknesses.",

Disturbing the slumber of the dead can only be justified in times of existential conflict, so these wraith constructs are designed to be formidable battle platforms: roughly twice the height of an Aeldari, and armoured in reinforced wraithbone. A Wraithguard no longer perceives the world as a living soul would, but their superlative combat instincts remain. These talents are further enhanced by the appalling distortion weaponry they wield in battle, designed to tear apart a body with invasive Warp energies, or cast a soul into the ruinous beyond.\n\nWraithguard are forged with a resilience most Aeldari warriors lack, and Agents equipped to handle fast-moving Asuryani may find their Blast or other anti-personnel weaponry struggles to penetrate a wraith construct's carapace. It is just as well the Asuryani only deploy Ghost Warriors in only the most dire circumstances, for low-Tier Agents are easily Annihilated by Wraithguard weaponry. However, the Spiritseers of Ul-Khari find themselves awakening their ancestors with increasing frequency in defence of their walls, but with each awakening they further risk the spirits of their beloved ancestors falling into the grasp of She-Who-Thirsts.",

Though the Spiritseers are deeply troubled by the anguish of these spirits, they are a useful asset in battle, as the Wraithblades vent their anger against the enemies of their Craftworld.\n\nWhilst Wraithguard excel at mid-range firefights, Wraithblades are melee specialists through-and-through, preferring to brutally engage groups of Agents where possible. Luckily, they can be outmanoeuvred, as they are neither fast nor as unnaturally graceful as living Aeldari. Whilst canny Agents can avoid melee by affecting a tactical retreat and firing on-the-move, the sheer resilience of the Wraithblades makes this a time-consuming strategy, allowing other Asuryani to seize unguarded strongpoints in the meantime.

Troupes may appear to toy with their enemies, enlisting them as unwilling participants in a dance they cannot understand. When a foe is close enough to behold a player's shifting, unsettling mask, they are subjected to the Harlequin's Kiss: a horrendous melee weapon that punctures the target's flesh, and shreds their insides with a whip of monomolecular wire.\n\nA troupe of players may act as an independent threat, or appear as allies beside an Asuryani, Drukhari, or Corsair force.

Like Asuryani Farseers, Shadowseers can perceive the twisting course of the future, but they are not prideful enough to avert its course. Instead, they consider themselves agents of prophecy, willingly enacting their visions as reconstructions of ancient Aeldari mythology.\n\nShadowseers are deadly battle-psykers — more directly combative than their Asuryani counterparts, and no less a master of witchcraft. Confronting them is as much a psychological battle as a physical one, as an Agent is assaulted by beguiling visions, struck by madness-inducing force weaponry, and confronted with their darkest secrets in the mirrored sheen of the Shadowseer's mask.",

Treachery and ambition are second nature to the ever-aspirant ranks of the Kabals, so to ensure their security and enforce their will the Archons turn to vicious serpentine mercenaries known as the Sslyth.\n\nThe Sslyth are an intelligent serpent-like species of unknown origin. While not exclusively employed by the Drukhari, their reliable nature and willingness to accept slaves as payment ensures a constant demand for their services in Commorragh where they find easy employment as mercenaries and bodyguards among the Kabals.\n\nThe Sslyth are particularly suited for combat. Their humanoid-like torso has two independently functioning sets of arms, each capable of firing and reloading simultaneously or capable of carrying an array of deadly blades. This maelstrom of death is propelled on a hulking serpent-tailed lower half, their bodies encased in thick, armored scales that glisten with a slick pearlescence.\n\nTheir combined reputation for savage violence and purchased loyalty guarantees the Sslyth are never far from the retinue of the Archons of Commorragh's dark Kabals.",

Formed into devastating raiding parties these Kabalite Warriors strike without warning and with merciless intent, butchering, and enslaving as their dark masters will.\n\nLike the rest of their Drukhari kindred the Kabalite Warriors are without forgiveness or remorse.

They are feared not only by the untold billions of denizens that inhabit the realms of Realspace but even by other Drukhari.\n\nThe origins of the Mandrakes are unknown, although often speculated upon. Some believe they are the foul and cursed offspring of baleful unions involving ancient Aeldari, while others think they are spawned from a nightmarish shadow realm beyond the Webway. Their true origins may never be known, having long been lost to the passing millennia.\n\nWith their shifting, shadow-like form pulsing with sickly green arcane runes and draped only in the tanned flesh of those who dare cross them, Mandrakes pull themselves from the shadows, capable of appearing and vanishing wherever the light fails to illuminate the darkness. Wielding baleful sickles and capable of turning the very life essence of their enemies against them, unleashed in wicked blasts of ice-cold spectral fire the Mandrakes are nightmares given shape, hungry to taste the suffering of others.",

Intelligent and vicious, they are a firm and well-known favorite of the Beastmaster hunts of the Wych Cults and great flocks of the creatures can often be seen accompanying their shamanic masters in Realspace raids.\n\nPossessed of an incredible speed, it is claimed that an adult Razorwing can boast a wingspan of up to thirteen feet. They are capable of descending on their prey with the lightning speed and ferocity of an Imperial fighter craft. The Razorwing is covered in iridescent feathers, each coming to a hard knifepoint at their tip. Their beaks and claws are equally sharp and capable enough to render armor and flesh with ease.\n\nRazorwing flocks descend on their prey with wanton ferocity, their initial impact splintering armor and tearing flesh as beak and claw rip their victim asunder. Holding blood-soaked viscera aloft the flock proudly displays their kill to their watching master before devouring them completely.",

While fiercely independent they are known to make deals to join Kabalite raiding parties or appear in the arenas of the Wych Cults to further their own ambitions.\n\nWith a cacophony of combat drugs and sense heightening stimulants coursing through their veins Hellions engage and excel in blood-stained spectacle, daring each other into ever more spectacular acts of aerial carnage for their own perverse amusement.",

The staff acts as a release valve, letting out psychic pressure before the Weirdboy bursts. This process is horribly painful for the Weirdboy and can prove deadly for if too much energy builds before they can release it causes their head to explode. Since the gestalt vigour of the Orks builds up constantly, most Weirdboyz avoid other Orks as much as possible. This often includes during combat, and many Weirdboyz wind up dragged onto the battlefield kicking and screaming against their will. Of course, this only riles up the rest of the greenskins, which, in a vicious cycle, gives the Weirdboy more power and agitates them further. Most Warbosses are kunnin' enough to give the Weirdboy room once sparks start flying.",

Huge swarms of Orks form together, utterly focused on some precise method of destruction that makes sense to them alone. A classic example of these hyper focused mobs are the Ork groups known as Tankbustas. Addicted to the sheer thrill of watching enemy tanks and war machines explode and delighting in the ensuing chaos these Orks are used by their Warboss as anti-armour troops, keeping the deadliest of their enemies guns away from the hordes of rampaging Boyz.\n\nTankbustas stalk enemy vehicles like game hunters. Making liberal use of numerous Rokkit launchas to blast targets from range; high explosive tank hammers swung by true short-term thinkers; short-fused bomb squigs strapped with explosives; all combine to help the Tankbustas to bring down their targets before ripping oily trophies from the still blazing wrecks. Stripping what they can from the slain wreckage before putting the looted scrap to use, turning it into more makeshift explosives and hunting out even bigger and deadlier targets.",

Riding and hunting fearsome beasts, fighting a decent enemy, and spreading general mayhem are the only things these Orks truly care for.\n\nWhile some of these Boyz ride into battle upon snarling, drooling Squigs they've beaten into subservience, they are just as likely to form huge angry throngs, single mindedly rushing forward to bring Choppas into their enemies.\n\nBig, brutal, and belligerent, Beast Snagga Boyz are a force to be reckoned with.

Runtherds are a notable exception to this, capable of taking on the tiresome task of managing a warband's grots and snots.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Orks are destined for a life of fightin', it is the Runtherds that ensure a warbands continued survival. The most basic and essential tasks in Ork society, such as cultivating fungus or rearing Squigs, fall to Gretchin and Snotlings. However, neither are particularly inclined towards productivity, so it falls to the Runtherdz to squeeze some work out of them. Through painstaking effort the Runtherdz train their charges to perform the sort of tasks that any Ork could complete, but almost none want to.\n\nOf course, Runtherdz don't refrain from battle entirely — they are Orks after all. When war looms the Runtherdz gather up their favourite Grabba Stikk and prod their dimunitive charges into action. Brimming with something akin to pride, the Runtherdz arm the Gretchin they have trained, point them towards the enemy, and send them off to almost certain death.",

Some are simply eaten, a dangerous game that provides a temporary distraction for the larger Orks, while others are used as mounts or trained to accompany their masters into combat. The variety found among squigs is truly vast, and those Imperial scribes who have attempted to document it have largely given up or been driven mad.\n\nWhile Squigs are bred and raised for specific purposes, all are vicious and aggressive by nature. With rows of bladed teeth, razor sharp claws, and an insatiable hunger, herds of Squigs are often set loose upon an enemy. While they do occasionally devour their handlers in a flurry of gnashing teeth, most Orks consider either outcome highly entertaining.",

Despite all the bravado and pomp, a Magus is totally enslaved to the Patriarch, and acts as an extension of their will, openly walking places where the Patriarch may not.\n\nMaguses outwardly appear almost Human, with no extra limbs, and just the signature ridged forehead.

If you appear too powerful or competent, your own Overlord or Phaeron will take notice, and while this can be a path to power, it can also be a mark of death. Your own peers will also vie with you constantly through means both foul and fair.\n\nOn top of this, a Lord will be expected to frequently lead their armies into battle, expanding their dynasty's power-base via relentless conquest.

Phaerons are adept at keeping their Overlords at each others' throats, and should one rival succeed to the throne then their first act is likely to be to settle a lot of old scores.\n\nConspiring against the throne, however, is to be discouraged by all means and the Phaerons prefer to keep their Overlords busy with campaigns of conquest.",

They strike fear into the scheming underlings of the viperous Necron courts, for it is well known that Wardens cannot be bought or blackmailed. Many ambitious Necron nobles have found their existence extinguished by the pitiless weaponry of the Royal Wardens after perceived treachery or failure.\n\nWhile intelligent and free-willed, Royal Wardens have additional engrams ensuring their loyalty, and hence are trusted implicitly to speak for their lord in negotiations. In turn, Royal Wardens tend to be granted access to the finest weaponry and wargear, so that they can function as champions.\n\nOn the battlefield the Royal Wardens direct phalanxes, ensuring that objectives are achieved. Should their lord wish (or be forced) to partake in combat, the Royal Warden will stand at their side, shielding them from assault and laying waste to their enemies. Steeped in ancient Necron traditions, Royal Wardens often hold themselves to a coldly honourable code of conduct.",

Given how vital the services of Technomancers are, they are often allowed a certain leeway by their Lords — even if this involves questionable experiments such as adapting the bodies of Destroyer Cult members.\n\nNecron royalty tend to value vehicles far more highly than their warriors, and a large part of a Technomancer's time will likely be spent producing or repairing vehicles for the dynasty. A Technomancer's lab will likely be filled with a variety of experiments, mostly focused on military research.",

The fascination that the Psychomancer's feel studying fear is partly to do with their longing for their own mortal forms, driving them to truly obsessive behaviour from time to time.\n\nWhen a Psychomancer takes to the field, it will be to test their theories by attempting to overload the senses or shatter the sanity of the organic species that they face. While they are figures of terror, their appreciation for drama sometimes prolongs a battle unnecessarily as they sadistically toy with their foes.

Canoptek Scarabs are deployed to break material down into raw energy to feed the Necron industrial processes — often using enemy warriors, vehicles, and structures as fuel. On the battlefield, vast, chittering swarms are usually deployed to cover the advance of more valuable units. Despite their small size, the mandibles of a Canoptek Scarab are capable of chewing through almost any material, and they are particularly prized for their ability to rip through heavy armour. Even the heaviest of enemy vehicles seldom has any way to defend itself against a Swarm once it is latched onto their hull. Scarabs are hard to target and can pour in through even a small gun port or glide over fortifications to envelop their prey. Scarabs are generally under the control of more complex Canopteks, and have only instinctive intelligence without being directed.",

Capable of projecting a beam which carries clouds of nanoscarabs directly onto damaged Necron materials, a Canoptek Reanimator can repair almost any Necron technology. For protection it wields a pair of Atomiser Beams, which can cause matter to soften, slide apart, and then fuse back together when the beam is switched off. Needless to say, this is a horrifying way to die, with gruesome injuries leaving the victim a tangle of melted flesh and bone, or fused with inanimate objects. The Reanimator's claws are also large and sharp, and can spear downwards with great force to pin struggling warriors to the ground. As with all Canopteks, Reanimators are merely sophisticated machines, and have no free will or desires of their own.",

Typically deployed in small squads, this can make for a devastating surprise assault as they strike down multiple officers, champions, and specialists simultaneously.\n\nDeathmarks wield a precision weapon known as a Synaptic Disintegrator that targets both body and mind for destruction. This means that even if an attack fails to achieve a kill outright, it may still snuff out the target's personality, leaving them a mindless husk.\n\nDeathmarks are so patient and stealthy that Crypteks have postulated that there may well be many of them scattered across the galaxy who were sent on missions only for their dynasty to fall. Without orders, they simply continue to fulfil their last instructions, and may do so for eternity.",

Each one sports as many fearsome Enmitic Disintegrator Pistols as they can physically carry, and their extensive modifications mean that they are capable of targeting and firing these independently.\n\nWhile 'sane' Necrons regard these beings as loathsome perversions of both mind and body, their undeniable effectiveness means that less principled leaders will sometimes engage their services. Lurking in their dimensional oubliettes, the Hexmark waits until the enemy comes into view (or their limited patience runs out), then appears in their midst, striking in all directions with blasts of energy which cause their victims to literally explode as their molecules repel each other. Once unleashed, there really is no controlling a Hexmark, and they will simply slaughter until they run out of targets to destroy.",

While their actions are undeniably effective, the growing presence of the Destroyer Cult within Necron society is deeply troubling to most Necrons capable of independent thought. The high casualties sustained by units such as the Skorpekh Destroyer are a relief to most of the Phaerons, but it doesn't stop many more members of the Destroyer Cults clamouring to replace them when they fall.",

Since then they have become boogeymen to many different species — horrible spectres that slip out of solid surfaces to ambush and slaughter before writhing away again. The dynasties rely on multitudes of such creatures to provide intelligence on their foes, and the Wraith's ability to phase through solid objects means there is nowhere it cannot reach or strike.\n\nThis ability to strike seemingly from nowhere is often devastating to enemy morale, and among the Necron's enemies hushed tales are sometimes told of intangible monsters hunting soldiers through the darkened corridors of their own fortresses.",

While they see extensive use in battle, they are also used as 'watchdogs' for sensitive areas like Necron armouries. As with all Canopteks, they have no true mind, and will follow their orders to the letter.\n\nTypically a Canoptek Doomstalker mounts an artillery piece known as a Doomsday Blaster which it can fire while moving, or root itself down to engage a much more powerful and long-ranged mode. It also carries a pair of Gauss-Flayers for fending off infantry attacks, and will engage a potent self-destruct mechanism if damaged beyond repair.\n\nGiven the peculiar challenges that the Canoptek Doomstalker presents to opponents, some Astra Militarum regiments that face them regularly have taken to forming specialised units to hunt and destroy them. The cost has proved high, yet from the handful of survivors from these units some interesting insights into the Doomstalker's tactical and physical vulnerabilities have been gained.",

Standing more than twice as tall as the average Fire Warrior, and piloted only by experienced Shas'ui, it is a striking presence on any battlefield. The XV8 can maintain contact with T'au troops through sophisticated communication systems, even while rapidly traversing the battlefield by use of its jet packs to take out the next high-priority target.\n\nOnly experienced Fire Warriors Shas'ui, who have proven their skill and courage, may don the Her'ex'evre — the Mantle of Heroes — and become battlesuit pilots. They often show favour for the XV8 as a combat and command platform, for its mobility, versatility, and firepower. In addition to its adaptable heavy weapons loadout, a Crisis Battlesuit's drone controllers allow additional customization, and can make it into a veritable one-T'au army that strikes terror behind enemy lines. However, if the XV8's strengths lie in its mobility, so do its weaknesses. A Shas'ui piloting their XV8 too boldly can easily find themselves outmatched when cut off from a route of retreat. XV8 operators must always ride that razor's edge to make best use of their battlesuit's capability — piloting it is a dangerous thrill.",

Operating behind enemy lines, these battlesuits are piloted by Fire Caste warriors often considered peculiarly aloof and even antisocial by their fellow T'au. These very qualities mark them as perfect infiltrators and saboteurs of course, and their independent thinking has produced more than a few revered tacticians. Operating outside of the tight-knit formations of the Fire Caste, however, sometimes for weeks on end, still makes them somewhat suspect among their kin.",

They are all equipped with either the standard T'au pulse rifle or carbines, powerful long-ranged weapons that can be devastatingly more effective than the Imperial equivalent standard-issue Lasgun. T'au weapons training emphasises precision. Fire Warriors prefer to mass fire from a stationary position, to pick off enemies before they can get into melee range.\n\nHolding the line requires Fire Warriors to operate in close-knit squads, where every soldier can rely on their fellows. Should even one among the squad's discipline break under fire, all may be lost. Their specialised training means Fire Warriors are less effective in close combat, where their only defence is symbolic: a Bonding Knife, which every one of them carries. This is an essential weapon but its main use lies before combat, not during. The mutual trust of all Fire Warriors is emphasised in a ritual ceremony known as Ta'lissera, where they become one blood through use of the Bonding Knife.",

To maximise the abilities of a skilled marksman, they are not themselves aiming a singular sniper rifle, but instead controlling a group of Sniper Drones.\n\nThis arrangement allows the marksman to remain at a distance from targets which effective shots would typically be impossible, by moving in their remote drones. This is made possible through some of the most sophisticated targeting sensors and drone uplinks the Earth Caste can provide outside of a battlesuit.\n\nDespite their best efforts, the resulting portable unit is still extremely bulky, all but eliminating the possibility of effective manoeuvring once a Firesight Marksman has taken up their position. Fortunately, a personal stealth field affords the marksman some protection. A skilled marksman further obscures their position by varying the angles at which their drones engage the enemy. The Firesight Marksman thus combines enormous striking potential with a flexibility not typically encountered in a sniper — at the price of extreme vulnerability should their position be discovered.",

The T'au rely on occupying favourable firing positions with their Fire Warrior teams from which they can make best use of their superior range. Accurate battlefield information, therefore, is essential for success. The Fire Caste thus requires specialised cadres who scout the battlefield for enemies approaching from blind spots in their firing lines, and to find the most advantageous positions in the ever-shifting environment of combat.\n\nCompetition to be admitted to the ranks of the Pathfinders is fierce, despite their less prominent role in combat. The T'au value stealth and cunning just as much as martial skill, and even more importantly is that Pathfinder assignments are often riskier than those of the average Fire Warrior, as they must operate independently and often in close contact with the enemy. Becoming a Pathfinder is thus considered highly honourable, and a direct path to Shas'ui. Pathfinder teams are equipped with state-of-the-art encrypted communication devices, to relay their observations back to those other T'au units whose lives depend on that information. Otherwise, Pathfinders travel light, with silenced weaponry and armour that emphasises quietness and mobility over protection.",

Their AIs, too, are of strictly limited capability, as their function is straightforward: lock onto a target and destroy it. Gun drones are most commonly mounted on T'au vehicles, such as the Devilfish, from where they can be detached to support landed troops while remaining under direct control by the pilot.\n\nHowever, T'au field commanders have discovered that linking the AIs of several Gun Drones provides just enough independence for a squadron of these simple-minded automatons to lay down smart fire support in tactically critical situations. Since gun drones are so basic, they are cheap to produce and generally considered expendable. When a Fire Warrior team must leave its entrenched position, a Gun Drone squadron can be deployed to cover them — as the first to emerge, the drones draw fire and are unlikely to survive for long, but better them than a valuable team of Fire Warriors. Gun Drone squadrons are also often deployed to probe enemy positions, or harass enemy lines to soften them up in preparation for an assault.",

Its main role is to scout far ahead of T'au troops, sometimes in conjunction with Pathfinder teams, but more often completely independently, as the T'au lack of manpower makes it impossible to cover all areas of interest.\n\nIn this role, the MB3 must make judgement calls of how to proceed, and its processing power borders on what many tech-priests would consider heretical. They would surely be worried by reports that some Pathfinders, operating isolated for weeks except for the company of a Recon Drone, converse with their MB3 as with an old friend.\n\nDue to their high cost during production, MB3's are programmed to disengage and preserve themselves when encountering overwhelming opposition. However to be able to fulfil their role effectively they are mounted with an anti-infantry burst cannon that allows them to dispatch light resistance. MB3s can relay their findings and position across vast distances, calling in T'au troops where required.",

The terror instilled by this reputation is a weapon in its own right.\n\nThese groups of hunters are the most commonly encountered Kroot outside of their home-world Pech, and indeed likely the most numerous T'au auxiliaries by a wide margin. While they share a special bond of blood and honour with the T'au, by whom they are valued just as much as Fire Warriors, they are perfectly willing to serve as mercenaries for other factions.\n\nKroot Carnivores are armed with the bladed Kroot staff rifles, modelled on their traditional combat sticks. They fire this weapon competently enough, but their main strength lies in close-quarters combat. A common Kroot tactic is to stealth as close to prey as possible, and then bridge the remaining distance with a vicious charge, peppering their foes with bullets before tearing into them with blade and beak.",

Due to the deep cultural significance consuming their prey as well as their own dead has to the Kroot, this gives the shapers great military, political, and spiritual authority.\n\nShapers lead Kroot Carnivores in combat, much like T'au Shas'ui lead Fire Warriors, allowing them to seek out foes with useful physiological characteristics. The shapers direct what is consumed by whom, to produce lines that ensure the Kroot prosper — this 'shaping' is aided by their ability to sample a prey's genetic make-up. Based on this capability to 'taste' a creature's biological essence, the shapers have declared Tyranids and beings mutated by Chaos 'inedible' — a term that signifies great revulsion and taboo among the Kroot. The shapers' instinctual access to genetic information seems to go as far as to allow them to access their ancestors' genetic memory in visions, to guide them in times of crisis.",

The Kroot use them as trackers on the hunt, as the hound's senses exceed even those of the most skilled Kroot Carnivore. In addition to the hound's keen eyesight, their entire spine ridge is covered in quills studded with sensory apparatus. By raising these quills up, Kroot Hounds can feel the vibrations in the air that herald the movement of their prey. They can sample a wide range of molecules wafting on the wind, far in excess of what any ordinary sense of smell could detect. Once they know their target's location, they tug their quills in tight to produce a sleek shape, ideal for the pursuit.\n\nWhile highly intelligent, and able to follow complex commands, it is also clear why the shapers consider the Kroot Hound a dead end: they are irascible and difficult to control — even experienced handlers have been killed by hounds they raised from pups. The Kroot thus often allow hounds to roam free in war, unleashing their instincts on the enemy without the danger of handling them directly.",

The herders ride their beast into combat, with a heavy cannon mounted on its back. In many ways, the Krootox thus fulfils the roles of a biological tank, and its thick hide is almost as well armoured.\n\nDue to their limited intelligence and simple, brutish nature, Krootox are thankfully easy to control. Bonded to a steady rider, they stay calm even in the heat of battle and can provide reliable heavy fire support as easily as they can wreck havoc among enemy lines. The Krootox' are also fiercely loyal and will fight valiantly to defend their handler and packmates. Some have even been observed stubbornly fighting against insurmountable odds to defend the shattered remains of their handlers killed in combat.",

Fortunately, these beasts don't form hunting packs as their smaller brethren do.\n\nKroot handlers don't shy away even from taming these distant evolutionary relatives, and young Great Knarlocs reared in captivity are surprisingly docile. To the Kroot, they are often most useful as beasts of burden — with their enormous strength and seemingly endless endurance, they can carry entire Kroot encampments from place to place, through even the roughest terrain. Great Knarlocs are thus central to the amazing self-sufficiency and mobility of Kroot armies on campaign.\n\nThis is not to say that Kroot wouldn't unleash the terrible fury of Great Knarlocs. Even tamed ones are prone to unpredictable bouts of aggression, which is why they are always kept muzzled and chained — right up until battle, when they are goaded towards the enemy. For these occasions, the Kroot mount heavy weapons on their backs — even though they can rip open battle tanks perfectly well with their beaks.",

Except for this communion helmet, strain leaders are not better equipped and are indistinguishable from other Vespid — for all their strict hierarchy, the Vespid seem to be a strangely egalitarian society.

They are deployed in support of T'au units who can keep up with them, such as Crisis Battlesuits, or those in desperate need of mobile anti-armor firepower, such as Pathfinder teams. The Vespid's signature weapon is the neutron blaster, based on their unique crystal technology and blended with T'au ingenuity. This exotic weapon literally strips atoms off its target and while it may slow-acting, its effect is reliable and constant, and neither ceramite nor flesh can withstand it. The neutron blaster is surprisingly light for a weapon with such devastating effect, but can only be operated by Vespid, due to the constant harmonic feedback modulation the crystals require.\n\nA distinct and severe potential difficulty with Stingwings employed in the service of the T'au is the complete and utter impossibility of direct communication with them. Only Vespid Strain Leaders are equipped with the rare Vespid communion helmets, which facilitates understanding. Vespid Stingwings who become isolated from their strain leader can become very confused and, worryingly, even hostile to their allies.",

During a mission to Persephone's Regret, his Sergeant and several squad members were incapacitated by enemy fire. Hofniel not only completed the mission but even carried the injured to safety, extracting them to ensure they survived for later treatment.\n\nThe Sergeant holds the members of Righteous Will to the highest standards. They drill constantly to maintain and expand a series of predefined fire combat drills, which can be adapted to most tactical situations. Hofniel is fluent in rapidly identifying the most appropriate of those for any engagement and issuing commands necessary to execute them. Hofniel trusts his squad to immediately comply, reacting to their actions with transhuman swiftness to account for issues arising from communications break down or deadly environmental conditions. When it comes to their fields of expertise, he expects his battle-brothers to have a knowledge base that goes beyond his own, and does not hesitate to ask for input.",

Puriel was born on the death world Newmann's Folly, where survival depended upon skill at arms and very limited technology. An Absolvers Chaplain recruited him to the Chapter after seeing him battle a massive felinoid in defence of a group of younger children. The Chaplain interceded to save the group from the enormous predator, almost certainly saving their lives. Seeing the child's grit, he brought him back to Castle Grigori to become an aspirant. During Puriel's training, he demonstrated such an affinity for close combat that several trainers expressed concern for his susceptibility to the Red Thirst.\n\nPuriel has served the Absolvers for nearly a century, a significant portion of which was spent as a dedicated member of an Assault Squad. Within Righteous Will, he serves as the primary melee combat specialist. He revels in the visceral feel of hand-to-hand combat, preferring to use his chainsword over any ranged weapons. In tactical discussions, Puriel advocates strongly for melee approaches and routinely advocates for plans that focus upon a stealthier approach that includes close combat. He feels that this is the purest way to dispense the Emperor's judgement. While he also advocates that focusing on close combat preserves necessary resources, even he would have to admit that this is not his primary motive.",

During those years, he has seen all the other members lost — some to reassignment and others to the vagaries of war. Throughout his time, his primary focus has remained the study and execution of the Codex Astartes. Briathos has exceptionally strong feelings, even by Adeptus Astartes standards, about internalising Guilliman's writings and applying them to all things. This application goes far beyond military matters, extending to all phases of life, including routine discussions with the fellow members of his Kill Team and those outside of it. He often quotes the Codex in conversation, using it as a key point in driving home his — or rather, the Primarch's — perspective on the discussion. Of course, his battle-brothers do not always agree with his interpretation or application.\n\nBriathos is most accomplished with his bolter, embracing the idea that it is the weapon most applicable in the broadest range of circumstances. Because of this, he spends additional time drilling with the weapon, and encourages the Kill Team's other members to join him in extra practice sessions. Briathos also enjoys performing routine maintenance on his bolter, as well as his other gear. He often assists his peers with the basic upkeep on their wargear, though this is probably at least partially to make certain that they are keeping all their equipment up to Codex requirements.",

In the months since, he has acquitted himself admirably. Marmaroth was particularly adept at infiltration and demolition missions during his service as a Scout, prior to completing his initiation. Those aptitudes have led him to build closer connections with both Brothers Puriel and Rogziel. During missions, he often works closely with one or both, providing backup for melee engagements or assisting when missions call for the deployment of ordnance.\n\nMarmaroth joined the Righteous Will as a direct replacement; his role within the team was to assume that of the fallen battle-brother ensuring any risk of performance loss was kept to a minimum. As a result, Brother Marmaroth must carry and use a flamer as his primary weapon. While he is competent with this weapon, he far prefers to wield his combat knife or bolt pistol. His greatest challenge has been learning to adapt to the flamer's utility, and while he still prefers the greater precision of his Astartes Combat Knife he has come to appreciate the devastation a gout of blazing promethium can provide. Despite his preferences, he has increased the amount of focus time drilling with the flamer and has enhanced his proficiency with the weapon. He longs to also experiment in using promethium in conjunction with his demolitions training, but has not yet had an opportunity.",

He is loath to adhere to the Absolvers' recent directives regarding supply conservation, instead preferring to be absolutely certain that threats are unequivocally eradicated. Where a single round might be enough to kill an opponent, he prefers to use two, to leave no question about their fate. He often makes light of this, insisting that he is not an Apothecary, so wishes to remain confident that his foes are properly dispatched.\n\nSince his assignment to the squad, this belief has led to an increase in collateral damages. This is particularly true on missions where the assignments explicitly call for demolitions work. Brother Rogziel seems to have an unusual knack for getting exceptional performance out of the ordnance he uses. His squadmates suspect that this might have to do with a tendency to exploit any other combustible materials that might be available, invariably finding a way to utilise any volatile substances nearby to augment the overall effectiveness of his equipment. In more candid moments, Brother Rogziel readily admits to the fellow members of the Righteous Will that his Sanguine Vision includes him dying amid an explosion. He has chosen not to share further details of his fate with his battle-brothers, lest he leave them unreasonably concerned.",

The Runtherdz of the Orks have painstakingly adapted their squig breeds to fulfil a wide variety of tasks, and this particular type is used to provide lubricant. Oily Squigs are scavengers, and will consume almost any organic material, but prefer fats and oils where possible. They store such chemicals in their plump, fleshy bodies, releasing it in a jet when they need to squeeze into tight spaces, or when startled. This makes them especially useful to Mekaniaks, who will generally ensure they have a supply of well-fed Oily Squigs on hand to lubricate their inventions. As with most of the barely understood orkoid species, Oily Squigs appear to reproduce through spores, and some such spores have apparently managed to find their way down into the lightless depths of the Unguent Pits. This is an ideal breeding ground for the invasive species, and they are reproducing rapidly. Whenever a pit opens, the squigs race from all around to dive into the precious fluid and gorge themselves, irreparably polluting the sacred substance in the eyes of the Mechanicus.\nNormally such beings would be exterminated by flamer-equipped servitors or Pteraxii Sterilyzors with phosphor torches, but such weapons can't be countenanced here. Any spark or flame could set off a chain reaction that would cause untold devastation. The Mechanicus here do not know the nature of the Oily Squigs or where they came from — they assume it is just some manner of mutated vermin from the hive-bottom. If the creatures were properly identified then the Ordo Xenos or a Magos Biologis would be able to advise on much more effective methods to sterilise the spores and stop the squigs from breeding. Individually the squigs are no challenge at all to an armed Human, at worst giving a painful bite. Even in swarms they are cowardly creatures.",

An arco-flagellant undergoes an extended program of surgical modification, including muscle grafts, combat drug injections, and cybernetically implanted weaponry. At the same time, the subject's mind is reconditioned to turn him into a berserk killing machine who seeks only to destroy enemies of the Emperor. Normally, an arco-flagellant is kept calm through the use of a sealed pacifier helmet. The helmet floods the arco-flagellant's senses with sacred images and songs, which renders the arco-flagellant virtually unresponsive to outside stimuli. However, once the proper activation word is given, the sensory input stops and a cocktail of combat drugs and stimulants are pumped in the arco-flagellant's body, turning the once- passive cyborg into a frightening and fearless combatant that exists only to destroy everything it sees. The use of a deactivation word will cause the arco-flagellant to shut down and resume its passive state."

    "description": "killed. Black Templars Neophyte Unlike other Space Marine Chapters, the Black Templars have no dedicated Scout Company in which its aspirants are trained. Should a survivor of the trials impress one of the assembled battle-brothers, an Initiate may take it upon himself to personally mentor the neophyte in the art of war. From that point on, the Initiate takes sole responsibility for his pupil's training and conduct. He swears an oath to prepare the neophyte for his entry into the brotherhood that is the Chapter, teach him of its history, and guide him through its holy rites of worship to the Emperor. In return, the neophyte pledges obedience to his master and vows never to bring dishonour to his name. Neophytes also act as servants to their mentors, waiting on them at the great banquets and seeing to their day-to-day requirements. The crusade's Chaplains oversee this training and make sure the neophyte learns the history of the Chapter and watch for any signs of weakness in the neophyte's faith. The neophyte will also accompany his Initiate into combat, and should his master fall, another brother will take up his training. The bond between the Initiate and his neophyte pupil is strong, and if the neophyte meets his end, the Initiate will swear a death oath to avenge his apprentice or die trying. It is the Initiate's prerogative to say when his apprentice's training is complete. Once he has proven his valour and skill, a Black Templars neophyte submits to the Chapter's Chaplains to undergo the final trials of purity before, in a ceremony of great reverence, he is elevated into the ranks of a full battle-brother of Initiate status and honoured with a suit of Power Armour. He is now truly a Black Templar, possessed of great power, and sworn to use it in the Emperor's service unto death."

    "description": "Cyber-Altered Task units (\"CATs\") are mechanical drones designed to perform simple tasks, like inorganic servitors. Programmed with a set of very simple instructions, they are occasionally used by the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Imperial Navy, and even some chapters of the Adeptus Astartes as remote probes and retrieval units. Though they do not possess any biological components, their extremely limited programming prevents them from being classified as examples of Abominable Intelligence. The drones utilise a simple short-ranged Vox transceiver which receives instructions from the user and relays data and pict-captures back to the user's control unit. The drone's ability to traverse environments independently is limited and relies more on simple trial-and-error than problem-solving ability. CATs have been in service across the Imperium for millennia, though their utility is limited compared to even a simple monotask servitor. Nevertheless, constructing CATs is a popular activity for Mechanicus Adepts and Techmarines, who claim that the activity is a useful meditative exercise, and CATs are frequently underfoot at any shrine to the Omnissiah, performing simple tasks for their masters and creators. In fact, some suspicious members of the Inquisition have observed that their creators seem to treat their CATs almost like pets, though the Mechanicum claims to be above such emotional attachments."

    "description": "Chapter serfs are the normal human bondsmen and servants of a Space Marine Chapter. The Space Marines themselves are too few in number to manage all the tasks required to maintain all the aspects of the Chapter, its fleet, fortress, and other myriad aspects. It is the serfs who perform most of these vital functions. A Chapter's fortress-monastery is home to a large population of these hereditary servants. Although they occupy a humble position, they are loyal members of the Chapter. They are generally descended from individuals selected as potential recruits to the Chapter, but in the end, judged unfit to become actual Space Marines. The serfs are still inducted into the Chapter cult, and do not begrudge the status they could have obtained. They are generally well treated within the Chapter, are educated and trained to a much higher standard than most other servants of the Imperium and have access to a better range of equipment. Many serfs were unsuccessful aspirants who failed to become Adeptus Astartes, and many more are descended from the failed aspirants of generations past. Chapter Serfs are known by a wide variety of names and titles depending on the Chapter they serve and the role they perform within their Chapter. They are sometimes referred to as thralls, menials, helots, or serviles, and they can be found in almost every part of a Chapter, assisting everyone from the Chapter Master to the Librarians and Tech-Marines, to the ordinary Battle Brothers."

    "description": "The servitors known as Cherubim are of uncertain origin, but they are one of the few permitted examples of such bio-sculpted homunculi allowed within the Imperium. Taking the form most commonly resembling that of somewhat corpulent and unwholesome looking genderless children, they are also often implanted with augmetic feathery wings (and a grav generator) allowing limited flight. Cherubim are not truly alive at all and their synthesised, bloodless and waxen flesh needs neither to eat nor sleep and is fed from their internal power-cell. They are controlled by an augmented cortex and nervous system usually harvested from some lesser creature such as a simian, bird, swine or felid, and implanted with a set of programmed commands that allows them to perform some simple task such as copying text, fetching and carrying small items or tirelessly singing the Emperor's praises with augmetic vocal cords. Outside the rarefied noble houses and Imperial hierarchy (most notably the Ecclesiarchy) where they are used, most citizens view Cherubim with a degree of distaste and superstitious fear. This is not entirely without cause as it is a matter of record that in rare instances Cherubim have been known to “devolve” allowing some corrupted and mangled version of their organic cortex to take over their behaviour with unpleasant consequences. These servitors are not purely functional in nature as their small chubby appearances are not suited for combat, maintenance, labour or any other such tasks. Their role was determined by the adept involved in their creation. Purposefully built as symbols of purity, they also serve as a form of decoration. Though not suited for combat roles, there are other more subtle tasks that a Cherub can be suited for such as spying, bearing weapons or equipment, being sycophants to their master and singing devotional hymns. Others possess integrated power generators allowing them to protect their master with an energy shield or anti-psychic equipment of use against psykers."

    "description": "Cyber-Mastiffs are mechanical creatures that resemble a metal hound, who are guided by the brain and nervous system of a hunting creature after such components have been integrated by members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. It is also not uncommon, however, to see purely biological canines who have received some form of cybernetic upgrades. Cyber- Mastiffs are usually deployed under the control of Adeptus Arbites Patrol and Enforcer units for hunting down their prey and to catch criminal fugitives who attempt to escape, but they are also found in other units, such as Anathema Psykana Pursuer Cadres, and even by underhive bounty hunters. Commonly known as kill-dogs, razorfangs and rending rovers, Cyber-Mastiffs have an in-built hunting and attack instinct and can only respond to the simplest of commands from their assigned handler but are still fully capable of defending themselves and their masters. They can be fitted with additional sensors, such as an Auspex, which are always used on passive."

The Space Wolves, in the ancient tradition of their Primarch Leman Russ, often befriend and train Fenrisian Wolves (in so much as such a feral being can truly be trained). Fenrisian Wolves will fight ferociously beside their master against his foes. Fenrisian Wolves are simple, brutal beasts, loyal only to their master and remorseless against their enemies. As a follower, a Fenrisian Wolf will trail behind the battle- brother wherever he goes, whining if forced to stay behind, and attack his enemies with a gesture or a word. Fenrisian Wolves aid Space Wolves in numerous ways during battle. Their speed makes them a great flanking unit with which to harry the Space Wolves' enemies and pick off smaller units. They are also used as a fast- moving distraction to the main battleline, leaving the Space Wolves' opponents guessing at their next move. They will also stay by the side of the battle-brother if he falls, protecting his body and maybe even pulling him to safety."

Owing to the idiosyncrasies of the little understood technology, usually only small, non-sapient creatures can become psy-bonded to a Human master. Psyber-Eagles are genetically and cybernetically enhanced familiars created as gifts from the Adeptus Mechanicus to the grandees of the Imperium.

    "description": "of mindless, cybernetic drones created from a fusion of Human flesh and robotic technology that are used to carry out simple, manual tasks across the Imperium of Man. Servitors were created due to the strict prohibitions against the development or use of machine intelligences according to the tenets of the Cult Mechanicus, whose tech-priests deeply fear the creation of Silica Animus. They believe such artificial general intelligences to be the embodiments of blasphemy against the Omnissiah. While many of these programmable cybernetic slaves are genetically-engineered, vat-grown, sub-Human clones or replicae created by the Adeptus Mechanicus from Human genomes who have their bionic implants installed after \"birth\", others were once truly Human. These servitors were usually criminals who fell afoul of Imperial Law, particularly a person who has offended or damaged the Adeptus Mechanicus in some fashion. These unfortunate criminals will be sentenced to Servitude Imperpituis by the Arbitrators or Judges of the Adeptus Arbites and will be handed over to the Mechanicus' Tech-priests to be mind-wiped, reprogrammed, and cybernetically-enhanced to serve some specific, rudimentary function. Once lobotomised and \"improved\" through the process of painful operations, even criminals and Heretics are granted one last chance to serve the Imperium. Servitors are generally mindless, semi-organic robots, possessing only the most basic of instincts, though some are fully capable of speech if such functions and knowledge are programmed into them. Their brains are reprogrammed to perform only the task they were designed for, whether that be maintenance, construction, or even warfare. The altered and fragmented brain of a servitor functions poorly unless constantly supervised. Most will eventually go into a state of mindlock, babbling incoherent nonsense as the servitor tries to assert some form of control over its functions. Calligraphus Servitor Outfitted with a cluster of manipulator arms, each tipped with various writing instruments, a calligraphus servitor is capable of copying practically any document they are given. They can also transcribe spoken words and are often used to preserve sermons and speeches as well as taking dictation for letters, orders, and regulations. Many high-ranking members of the Holy Ordos have at least one calligraphus servitor on hand, while large monasteries and abbeys may have hundreds, usually engaged in replicating and preserving ancient texts."

Presumably, to have one's skull chosen to serve as a Servo-skull is a great honour in the Imperium. Servo-skulls fill an important niche in Imperial work, serving as everything from auto-scribes that copy down important conversations and confessions of prisoners, to simple moving torches, hovering about their charge with electro-candles and lumen-globes to illuminate the area. Servo-skulls are used throughout all the different organisations of the Imperium, and each is built to perform a certain task.

Having dealt with sorcerous practices and energies for decades and now under the sway of Chaos, mutation ran wild within the Legion.[4a] In order to put an end to this warping process, a mighty spell called the Rubric of Ahriman was cast upon them. However, the powers unleashed reduced all Marines without psychic abilities to ash, sealing every clasp and joint of their armour and trapping their souls within. These living suits are still capable of fighting and receiving orders from their masters, and with no fear and no will of their own, they make perfect bodyguards and guardians. Without an Aspiring Sorcerer to guide them, Rubric Marines tend to fall into inactivity; in combat, however, their battle-hunger returns and so they tend to move more like their former living selves. A single Sorcerer is capable of controlling a whole squad and will use his powers to enchant their bolters and turn their ammunition into explosive Inferno Bolts. These magical shots are able to ignore mundane armour and burn the souls of sentient beings. When a Rubric Marine dies, the dried remains of his material form pour from his rent armour and are scattered to all winds of the battlefield. After this, only the most powerful sorcerers could re-collect this dust, reseal the armour, and through a complicated ritual reanimate the Rubric Marine to a new \"life\". The sorcery required for this deed are very dangerous and just one syllable misspelled could drive the Sorcerer insane - or kill him outright."

These birds are commonly kept as pets and hunting animals by Aeldari, and some Anhrathe carry their Faolchú into battle to serve as scouts. The innate psychic abilities of the Aeldari allow them to form close bonds with their animal companions, without the clumsy augmetic devices used by humans, or the brutal ‘discipline' of Orks."

Gyrinx are not intelligent as such, but they have an astounding ability to empathize with other creatures, forming a mental bond with their owner which is comparable to true friendship. This bond is of great benefit to the creature's owner, whose own speed of thought and action are actually improved while the Gyrinx is in close proximity. What benefit the Gyrinx obtains from the relationship is unclear, but there is plainly some deep- seated need being fulfilled, because an owner-less Gyrinx will actively seek out and adopt another creature. Oddly enough, Gyrinx show a slow metabolic change so that they can come to resemble their owner physically, temperamentally and in habit."

    "description": "A Squig (short for \"Squiggly Beast\") is the simplest known form of Orkoid life. There are many types of Squig, each generally filling some functional or utilitarian role in the Ork ecosystem. They currently serve as the Orks' primary food source, much like herd animals are for Humans. Attack Squigs are one of the most common types of Squig. An Attack Squig is a bouncing ball of claws and razor-sharp teeth, with immense variations in morphology between individuals, with some having horns and a devil-like tail, while others are single-eyed or single-nosed creatures. Gretchin use them as both a food source (if the Squig doesn't eat them first!) or as a weapon of war, pushing herds of them into the enemy. Orks like to keep them as pets, and sometimes even as weapons as well. Bomb Squigs are little more than common Squigs with explosives strapped to their sides or gripped firmly in their teeth. When properly goaded, they run headlong at their master's desired target, detonating their explosive payload when in close proximity. Squighounds, commonly known as \"Growlers,\" are a variation of the Attack Squig, used by Ork Runtherdz to help them keep the Gretchins and slaves from other races in line, some have four legs, although two-legged varieties certainly exist. \"Growlers\" are also often kept as a form of pet by other Orks, as they are roughly the size of a small dog, hairy, and particularly vicious."

Grot Gretchin or Grotz are basically a smaller subspecies of Orks, who are more cowardly than normal Orks and are usually used as living shields, to clear mine fields, are stepped on to get through difficult terrain, and sometimes even as emergency rations. Gretchins are quite low in the strict hierarchy of Ork society because of their small size (the lowest Orkoids being the Snotlings) and are often used for the dirtiest jobs like scavenging and being used as the football when the bigger Orks get bored. While they are not as aggressive as standard Orks, they enjoy fighting weaker opponents and are less likely to flee if they comfortably outnumber their opponents. If a Gretchin is particularly wealthy, he may purchase a second-hand, worn-down, low-tech gun. These guns are mainly to reassure the Gretchin that they have a chance of killing something, provided they remember which way to hold the gun. Even so, Gretchin have to be forced into battle by Runtherdz who utilise grabba sticks in order to ensure that the Gretchin stay in battle. A skilled Runtherd can grab a fleeing Gretchin and hurl him into a minefield with one smooth motion. The more tech-savvy of the Runtherdz use a grot prod which delivers an electric charge to a Gretchin's vulnerable parts. Basically, all Gretchin work as slaves for Orks, although there is a faction of revolutionary Rebel Grots that developed in the chaos of the Ork World of Gorkamorka. As they are a bit more organised than the larger Orks, Gretchin are often used to maintain Greenskin war machines and artillery. Such work is considered highly undesirable by most Orks because it prevents them from being in the heart of the battle. Gretchin also serve as attendants or \"ammo runts\" to Ork Warbosses, assistants to Ork Mekboyz, and orderlies to Ork Mad Doks."

    "description": "MV 8 Missile Drone 7 Very Rare T'AU EMPIRE, DRONE, XV88 A Tau Drone (Kor'vesa in the Tau language, meaning “flying helper”) is a form of artificial intelligence extensively utilised by the Tau Empire for a variety of combat and non-combat purposes. The mobile variants of Tau Drones exist in the form of sleek disk-shaped machines which are well-armoured and equipped with small anti-gravitic engines and manoeuvring jet- thrusters so that they can hover and skim across the ground. As they hover over landscapes, rotating back and forth, their sensor vane constantly transmits vital information about their surroundings. These types of Drones are commonly seen alongside the warriors of the Fire Caste, but similar designs can be found buzzing through the streets and skies of any T'au settlement. Although small and innocuous, those foes that underestimate Tau Drones often pay for such a costly mistake with their lives. In addition, Drone intelligences can also be found built into a great number of technologies developed by the Tau Earth Caste, giving a simple synthetic intellect to a wide array of devices. There are many different types of Drones utilised by the Tau in varying roles; these can range from mundane civilian uses to multiple combat roles. Tau Drones can carry a wide variety of equipment, ranging from defensive Shield Generators to offensive weaponry, communications equipment, and various combat support systems. Most Tau Drones can interact with their Tau masters, obeying simple instructions and even anticipating what duties are required of them. The Tau value their Drones, and whilst they are not regarded as having equal status to a Tau, they are treated much like a favoured animal companion amongst humans. A basic T'au Drone has the following profile, which is then modified according to the type of Drone desired:"

They are a subspecies of Tyranid Gaunt armed with razor-sharp Scything Talons and move on powerful hind legs in a series of exceptionally fast, bounding leaps that appears as a skittering, insect-like gait.\nBefore the full attack of a Tyranid Hive Fleet, Hormagaunts are often dropped in Mycetic Spores in such large numbers that even if many are destroyed by orbital defences those that make planetfall will pose a serious problem to any inhabitants.\nHormagaunts have a deadly instinctual ability to hunt that needs little direction from the Tyranid Hive Mind. They are so single-minded in hunting that they will ignore personal injury and tiredness until they have run down their quarry. Hormagaunts will then feed upon their prey, ripping pieces of flesh apart with razor sharp teeth. However, their extremely fast metabolism will always drive them to constantly seek out new victims. They are usually left to their own devices once a Tyranid attack is underway, though occasionally the Hive Mind will intervene and direct them towards a more distant and more important target.\nHormagaunts, unlike other Tyranid creatures, can lay hundreds of eggs in the ground and so reproduce independently of a Hive Fleet. Each Hormagaunt has a short lifespan—days at most—but once one generation has died a fresh wave will have hatched and grown to maturity, ready to carry on ravaging a world where the previous generation left off.",

These small xenos warriors most commonly carry the dreaded Fleshborer Biomorph but have been known to carry other more potent weapon Biomorphs into battle. While ineffective in combat as a small group, they are most powerful when swarming in large broods across a target planet once the Great Devourer's invasion reaches its high tide. The desperate need to survive makes them a menace even if their synaptic control with the Tyranid Hive Mind is broken, as they run to cover and will lurk waiting to kill whatever threatens their hiding spot.\nTermagants are naturally cunning and have a strong sense of self-preservation. Often, they will skirt an enemy ambush and instead find a way to assail their foe from an unexpected quarter, or they will seek out and exploit enemy weak points. If cut off from the Hive Mind's influence, a Termagant's self-preservation instinct will take control and they will typically abandon the fight in search of shelter. This seeming weakness means however that Termagants remain a threat once a Tyranid assault has been defeated since every cave, ruin, or path of undergrowth that surviving defenders pass by could conceal a nest of Termagants ready to attack upon discovery. In some circumstances the Hive Mind will suppress the survival instincts of Termagants to instead send them rushing forward for the sole purpose of depleting enemy ammunition stores.",

Their prime purpose seems to be seeking out the enemy and sowing terror and confusion amongst them. Thus, fire and the flap of the Gargoyles' membranous wings precede the Tyranid hordes, driving the enemy out into the open to be absorbed by the swarm, spitting death from their Fleshborers.\nPhysically, Gargoyles strongly resemble the Termagants from which they are genetically derived, with compact but lithe bodies encased in a lightly armoured exoskeleton. They have wide, leathery wings, raking claws and barbed tails. They also display the same animal cunning as their ground-dwelling counterparts, and instinctively assail the foe from an unexpected quarter whenever the situation allows.\nWinged manoeuvrability gives the Gargoyles a distinct advantage over most opponents, who for the most part rely on technological assistance to fly. As a result, Gargoyles have earned a dread reputation, a legend that, in truth, far outstrips their physical threat. Wherever Gargoyles are abroad, defenders look fearfully to the skies, for they know that every skyborne shadow could be a flock of Gargoyles about to attack.\nWhile they are built for ranged combat, Gargoyles are not helpless in melee. They can spit a toxic fluid, which they instinctively aim at the eyes of their opponents to blind them. Then they tear into the foe with barbed tails and talons until either they or their prey are slain, or the Hive Mind relinquishes its control.",

Rippers are the most numerous of the Tyranid creatures, and in great swarms they can pull down and consume creatures many times their own size.

During the final stages of a Tyranid planetary invasion, they scour the entirety of a planet, ingesting all biological material on the planet and leaving only an empty and desolate wasteland.\nEventually, the Rippers will become bloated full of biomass, unfit for combat. At this point, they simply crawl into Tyranid Reclamation Pools at the bases of impossibly tall Capillary Towers that project beyond the atmosphere, where they and the biomass they have fed upon are broken down and absorbed by the Hive Fleet for the creation of new Tyranid organisms and structures.

    "description": "A Genestealer (Corporaptor hominis) is a bioform of the Tyranids that was genetically designed by the Hive Mind for the infiltration of other intelligent species' settled worlds. Genestealers serve as the vanguard organisms of the Hive Fleets. The first Tyranids to be discovered by the Imperium, their true nature is obscured by a confusing multitude of legends. They are known as \"Snatcher-devils\" on some Imperial worlds, \"Cave Nightmares\" on others and \"Clawed Changelings\" on yet more. Every conceivable interpretation of the Genestealer Curse has been posited across Mankind's domain, but even the most outlandish story does no justice to the awful truth behind these creatures and the reproductive cycles of genetic damnation they propagate.\nGenestealers are also used by the Hive Mind as a primary shock assault unit for Tyranid swarms during surface and void battles. Countless archivists and xenographers have studied the variance and mutability of Genestealers extensively, and while there are many theories about different genetic strains, it has been identified that those encountered as part of a Hive Fleet are subtly different to those found infesting other worlds. Where a Genestealer is part of a larger Hive Fleet, it will operate as part of a single brood of normally around a dozen kin (sometimes fewer, sometimes more). The brood communicates via telepathy, operating semi-independently of the Hive Mind.\nThis broad tendency, though debated, has been categorised by some as the Belligerum-Strain, to distinguish it from Genestealers demonstrating different proclivities in different situations, such as the leaner, faster Vectori-Strain identified on some Space Hulks, and Purii or Purestrain Genestealers identified as gene-stock within cult infestations. Belligerum-strain Genestealers are bulkier, hardier, and more suited to front-line battlefield conditions.\nSpeculation exists that these forms of Genestealer are different phases of life, adaptations made during a Genestealer's lifespan to suit different situations. Other claims maintain that Hive Fleets produce different subspecies of Genestealer for different purposes. The truth is a mystery, as studying these creatures is a deadly matter.",

    "description": "The Tyranid bioform known as the Lictor (Tyranicus chameleo) is a specialised evolutionary development of the Tyranid Warrior, highly adapted to a role as a scout in the vanguard of any Tyranid swarm's advance. Lictors move ahead of the swarm, seeking out pockets of resistance to be eradicated and native life forms to be absorbed. Able to move swiftly and without sound through even the densest terrain and concealed by a chameleonic carapace that renders it all but invisible to the naked eye, a Lictor can remain hidden until it chooses to strike. It can wait motionless for days, unnoticed by its victims, an unseen herald of approaching disaster.\nLictors are the lone hunters of the Tyranid swarm, roving ahead of the Hive Fleet, seeking out prey and leading the Hive Mind to concentrations of enemies. As tall as a Tyranid Warrior, Lictors are distinct in appearance from other Tyranid creatures in several ways, such as a pair of long mantis-like claws extending over the creature's shoulders which it can use for climbing and impaling its prey; long, drooping feeder tendrils that hang from its maw and greatly increase its senses and shimmering chameleonic scales which allow it to hide with ease. A natural predator, the Lictor is patient and stealthy and can move past even the most alert foes, or spend days hiding immobile, waiting for a chance to strike once its prey's guard is down. This behaviour has given the Lictor an almost mythical reputation amongst its foes, as a ghost-like horror which can strike at any time and place, before vanishing into thin air just as easily.\nA Lictor's primary purpose is to lead the Tyranid swarm to fresh prey and seek out large groups of foes that might be hiding or fleeing before the swarm. In this role, they move silently and almost completely invisibly across all kinds of terrain, using their enhanced senses to find their foes. These opportunistic hunters tend to avoid confrontations where they would be outmatched, silently stalking their prey from the shadows. Stalking Lictors also serve another deadly purpose than simple slaughter; exuding a potent pheromone trail which draws other Tyranid bioforms to the slaughter. The larger the concentration of prey, the stronger the response and the more irresistible the lure. As scouts, Lictors can operate outside the Hive Mind's synaptic web, so they do not need to remain close to a controlling Tyranid synapse creature.",

As Tyranids are constantly biologically adapting their forces to match their enemies' shifting strategies, Tyranid Warriors are often seen in combat in many different sub-species intended for different battlefield functions. Tyranid Warriors are among the most important Tyranid species deployed by a Hive Fleet in battle, as not only are they powerful and deadly creatures, but they also serve as Tyranid synapse creatures, the important species intended to direct lesser Tyranid species and forming the focal points of the Tyranid Hive Mind's system of telepathic command.\nTyranid Warriors are large creatures, but still smaller than the massive Tyranid Hive Tyrants. They are fast and powerful, with the capability to be strong at ranged combat or in close quarters in a similar fashion to the Hive Tyrant.\nAccording to Imperial research conducted by the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Tyranicus gladius species itself is highly adaptable to any battle role, with over 212 known variants of Tyranid Warriors having been observed - combining flying, walking, leaping biomorphs, with biomechanical symbiotes that serve as ranged weapons like the Deathspitter or assault symbiotes like scything talons or rending claws or both. This has caused one Imperial researcher, Magos Biologis Locard, to claim that the Tyranid Warrior is the most adaptable of any Tyranid species yet encountered.",

The Tyranids' leadership caste is difficult for Imperial commanders to identify, and there is often the mistaken assumption that the larger a Tyranid creature is, the more important it is to the swarm. This is a mistake that has cost more than one Imperial officer his rank and countless men their lives. This is especially true for Tyranid Warrior Primes, an evolution of the standard Tyranid Warrior genus that has an elevated intelligence and a stronger link to the Tyranid Hive Mind.\nIn military function, Tyranid Warrior Primes take on the role of junior officers within a Tyranid swarm. Much in the same way as a Hive Tyrant might lead a full host of Tyranids, a Warrior Prime will oversee a smaller section of the battlefield or direct a smaller strike force of warriors. When close to a more powerful synapse creature they will defer their control, acting instead like non-commissioned officers, often personally leading broods. However, should they find themselves alone, they can easily bind together those Tyranid creatures nearby into an effective fighting force and carry on with little trouble. In this way, a Tyranid Warrior Prime is just as capable of directing a swarm as a Hive Tyrant and many an Imperial officer has suffered because of underestimating their ability to project the Hive Mind and lead lesser Tyranid creatures.",

Deep within its squat, lumpen form, the Biovore nurtures a clutch of Spore Mines - living bombs that clouds the battlefield and covers enemies in acids, poisons, and jagged shards of chitin. A Biovore launches these mines from a dorsal aperture by means of a powerful muscle spasm. Even if the shot misses its target, the danger is far from over, for the Spore Mines are possessed of a rudimentary intelligence and detonate not on impact, but when they sense the proximity of a non-Tyranid lifeform.\nFortunately, the Biovore's relative rarity amongst the Tyranid swarms is taken as a sign that the Hive Mind prefers to win its battles in bloody melee, but the truth is subtly different. Over time, as the Hive Fleets pressed ever deeper into the galaxy, their victories were much harder won as their enemies began to concentrate on destroying the swarm from great distance. In response, the pragmatic Hive Mind recognised the need for a bioform that could neutralise the enemy's long-range weaponry, thus leading to the birth of the Biovore. Imperial savants believe that the Hive Mind may have made use of Orkoid genetic material to create the Biovore. Thus, this creature is not merely a powerful weapon in the Hive Mind's arsenal, it is living proof of the adaptive nature of the Tyranid menace.",

If injured, the acidic contents of a Pyrovore's various stomachs sprays out of its wounds over its enemies; if killed, the volatile ichors of a Pyrovore's insides have a good chance of igniting in a tremendous explosion, engulfing everything around it. A Pyrovore has limited intelligence, driven only by the need to feed. Its flamespurt weapon-symbiote has a separate brain that functions independently from the Pyrovore, unlike many other Tyranid organisms which bond their minds with their bio-weaponry.

This massive Tyranid organism serves as a living incubator capable of spawning Termagants. Beneath a Tervigon's lumpen carapace dozens upon dozens of Termagants slumber in a state of hibernation. The Tervigon spawns its dormant broods at will, so that a foe engaging it will soon find itself assailed by waves of skittering Termagants.\nThe only way to end this menace is to concentrate all firepower on the Tervigon and slay it. The resulting symbiotic backlash through the Hive Mind inevitably kills its spawn. Despite its massive size, the Tervigon can be deadly in close combat, shifting its weight onto its rear legs and scything its claws back and forth in crushing arcs. The Tervigon should also not be underestimated at range -- its carapace conceals banks of cluster spines that can be fired at a considerable distance.\nWhilst traveling through space, Tervigons do not slumber in a dormant state. Instead, they roam the Hive Ship's cavernous innards. Should they detect intruders, they can spawn an army of frenzied Termagants to repulse the foe whilst using their potent synaptic links to awaken additional warriors.",

It is as unyielding in battle as any war engine constructed of steel or crafted from more conventional technology. The Tyrannofex has the armour and fortitude of a living battle fortress and its bio-weaponry eclipses that of its foes' most powerful main battle tanks in both quantity and destructive potential. Worse, its body houses several breeding chambers, nurturing all manner of ferocious Tyranid organisms that it can unleash onto any enemy foolish enough to come too close. Its main weapon is a massive Bio-Cannon fused with its torso, the largest and most destructive of any of the Tyranid bioweapons carried by a Bio-Titan. The precise nature of this weapon differs from Tyrannofex to Tyrannofex.\nGiven its massive size, the Tyrannofex is ungainly and prone to being overwhelmed when engaged in a long melee battle. However, the Tyranid Hive Mind has adapted this biomorph to compensate for this weakness. When the Tyrannofex finds itself in difficulty, it can emit a stress pheromone that attracts other Tyranid bioforms more suited to close combat.",

In these last stages, enormous capillary towers and spore chimneys emerge from the ground, the former growing with astounding speed past the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere, to channel the processed organic soup to orbiting Hive Ships.\nAs these towers and chimneys enable the Tyranids to achieve the ultimate goal of their planetary invasions, the Tyranids take particular care to defend these structures well. Indeed, the Hive Mind seems to have developed the Hive Guard specifically to fulfil the important function of standing watch over these towers. Typical of the ever-efficient Tyranids, Hive Guard have a short incubation period and are spawned only when needed in the final stages of the harvest and only when the capillary towers and spore chimneys face an enemy threat.",

There is no way past this deadly obstacle, and those who approach are clubbed to death or hacked apart, their ruptured bodies joining the moat of gore that surrounds the xenos shield wall. Not a single one of these organisms moves to chase a fleeing enemy; they stand immovable, ignoring the storms of fire that ricochet from their thick hides.\nTyrant Guard are the ultimate bodyguards; it is the entire purpose of their creation. They are driven by a bestial consciousness that knows little save for a ferocious loyalty to the Hive Tyrant they protect. Bodyguards from other species defend a charge out of a feeling of duty, suppressing their own survival instincts to do so -- a fundamental conflict that slows reaction times.\nTyrant Guard suffer no such limitations, for they are near-mindless beasts engineered for but a single task. Their instincts tend not towards self-preservation, but to the defence of the Hive Tyrant to which they are bonded. Should the Hive Tyrant come under attack, its Tyrant Guard hurl themselves into the path of incoming fire without thought or concern, sheltering their master with their own bodies until the threat is ended or death takes them.\nThese organisms are blind, possessing no discernible means of seeing the enemy. However, eyes are not necessary for these bodyguards, for when they are guarding a Hive Tyrant, they become extensions of their master's own body.",

They can effectively hunt prey by detecting an unguarded signal and tracking it back to its origin. Thus, the enemy's technology is turned against them, and any concealed outposts or infiltrators are not hidden from a Ravener.\nRaveners, like many Tyranid organisms, are essentially unthinking beasts when not under the influence of the Hive Mind.

Millions of spores seep into respirator tubes and clog gas mask filters, feeding upon the moisture of their host and growing at a rapid rate.\nToxicrenes are typically sent forth by a Hive Fleet after the initial swarms of gaunts and other basic warrior-forms have forced the prey world to expend most of its firepower.

Under a Venomthrope's heavy carapace is a network of bulging, gas-filled bladders that emit yellowish spore clouds. These clouds are lethal to non-Tyranid organisms and dense enough to obscure nearby Tyranid organisms.\nThese numerous gas-filled bladders (also the source of the toxic cloud that fills the air around it) allows the Venomthrope to move along by using its tentacle-like hooked tendrils to drag its lighter-than-air body across any surface. These same tendrils are also used to snare enemies and drag them into its poison cloud, where it holds them fast until their feeble struggles cease and it can devour them at its leisure. Not as powerful a combatant as a Tyranid Warrior or Ravener, the Venomthrope relies mostly on its poisons to do its work, expecting only mild resistance from its prey once it gets close enough to envelope them with its cloud or touch them with its deadly tendrils.\nVenomthropes are not just toxic to non-Tyranid life forms, but also to any environment they enter. Over time their miasma of toxic spores infects the ground and air of a world unlucky enough to feel its venomous touch, rendering it hostile to even its own indigenous species.",

    "description": "A Trygon is a species of Tyranid that is similar to the smaller Ravener and often leads their hordes into battle. It creates huge burrows to tunnel behind enemy lines and uses its acute senses to detect the presence of enemies above it. It is a deadly close combat specialist making use of six clawed arms, razor sharp teeth and a bio-electric field that flows through its armour and can incapacitate attacking enemies. It is also a particularly good stealth operative for the Tyranids, popping up behind enemies and slaughtering them where they stand.\nThe Trygon is a vast serpentine creature, so colossal that it towers over even the mighty Carnifex. It is a heavily armoured monster, covered from head to tail with a thick carapace of shifting plates. As the Trygon moves, these plates generate a potent bio-static charge that courses along the length of the beast's body and wreathes its bladed forelimbs with crackling power. The Trygon can direct this energy as a lethal high-voltage discharge -- unleashing pulsing arcs of lightning that leave its prey as little more than a charred pile of scorched bones.\nTrygons excavate a massive network of underground tunnels as they burrow beneath the surface of a prey world. Other Tyranid creatures use the passageways left in the Trygon's wake, scuttling unseen as battle rages overhead. The emergence of a tunnelling Trygon therefore often heralds a larger Tyranid attack, with hordes of creatures pouring out of the tunnel shortly after its emergence.",

They are burrowing creatures that travel deep underground to bypass enemy defences and then emerge behind enemy lines to run rampant through supply lines, command posts, or artillery batteries, only to vanish back underground to evade retaliation. Severe earth tremors are the only warning of a Mawloc attack.\nPhysically, the Mawloc is an incredibly simple organism with most of its known bio-morphs geared solely towards burrowing into the earth where possible. It has powerful limbs employed to gain traction underground, but they are small and lack the reach to be efficient in combat. Instead, it attacks by swallowing prey whole with its massive razor-toothed maw, or it pounds larger foes flat with its muscular tail before eventually devouring them as well. Despite its immense size and mass, a Mawloc is incredibly agile and able to weave through incoming fire with fluid grace.\nA Mawloc is almost entirely blind and relies on a series of pressure-sensitive organs that run the length of its flank, which provide the Mawloc with a clear picture of the world around it. A Mawloc's senses are so acute that it can absorb and interpret pressure waves as they travel through both solid and liquid matter. Mawlocs can intercept their quarry with unerring speed and accuracy, even whilst burrowing through ground.",

These dedicated arsonists take great delight in setting fire to the enemy (and anybody and anything else they can lay their hands on if no enemy is available) and it takes a strong Warboss or the blackmailing powers of the Meks to keep them in line.\nHowever, the benefits of these lunatics in any Ork warband just about outweigh the risks of getting anywhere near them. The Burna Boyz can be a powerful asset on the battlefield, whether in small team or large mobs; their mass incendiary firepower can prove devastating, particularly against enemy infantry, flushing out foes from defended positions and bringing down bestial creatures. Also, with their weapons turned to the searing hot point of a blowtorch flame, they can wield them to hack and slice up enemy armour and vehicles. They serve a vital secondary role in this regard, cutting up battlefield salvage for later use.",

    "description": "A Kommando is an Ork Boy specialist who prefers to rely on \"kunning trikz\" instead of fighting his opponents head-on like most other Greenskins. Kommandoz serve as the Orks' infiltrators and saboteurs, and are experts in the arts of stealth, ambush, unconventional tactics and striking at the opponent from a totally unexpected quarter.\nUnlike Boyz, these Orks use dirty tricks like stealth, camouflage, and creating distractions. Such methods rely on a trait lacking amongst Orks -- discipline. Though Kommandos exist in all Ork clans, other Orks tend to distrust them.\nMost consider the use of stealth and camouflage distinctly un-Orky, as killing the enemy before they get to fight defeats the point entirely. Though Warbosses instinctively understand a Kommando's tactics, most are deeply uncomfortable in the presence of any Ork that would voluntarily stay quiet.\nThe aberrant mindset that distinguishes each Kommando serves the entire tribe; just as the average Ork is driven above all to fight, a Kommando finds the highest pleasure in covert operations. Sneaking through an enemy base to slaughter surprised enemies, patiently waiting to strike to make an ambush more successful, utilising timed explosives to cripple supply lines; all epitomise Mork's battle \"taktiks.\" Some Kommandos range so far ahead of the tribe that they find themselves deep behind enemy lines -- so deep they are forgotten, continuing long campaigns without orders, executing stealth missions purely for pleasure.",

They live to get stuck into a good, bloody fight as quickly as they can. To this end, the Stormboy Korps strikes deals with local Meks to equip them with large, noisy Rokkit Packs.

    "description": "The armies of the Astra Militarum are made from billions of regiments, recruited from every world in the Imperium. There is no universal uniform for these Guardsmen; warriors don the armour and wargear native to their homeworlds.\nThe only piece of armament common to all Guardsmen is the Lasgun, and even then, some regiments from more technologically primitive worlds have been trained with only black powder muskets, crossbows, or even spears. The fighting ability of each regiment reflects the human world and society it comes from. Some planets breed cunning gang fighters whilst others raise savage and barbaric warriors.\nGuardsmen are disciplined troops indoctrinated to follow orders to the letter. In the face of the enemy the serried ranks of the Astra Militarum are trained to stand firm and respond with a steady aim. When sergeants bellow, the rank-and-file obey; backs stiffen and Lasguns level at the foe. Opponents charging at Imperial Guard positions must first survive a blazing hail of las-fire, a fusillade that can stem the tide of all but the most determined assault.\nThe fate of battles is often decided upon the courage and mettle of Imperial Guard Infantry Squads -- but they are still only Human. On equal terms they are no match for the many alien and Chaos-tainted horrors they must face. Should such enemies close the distance between themselves and an Infantry Squad, the Guardsmen, more often than not, are slaughtered.\nAlthough some Guardsmen are equipped with a variety of powerful and specialised weaponry, the primary strength of the Astra Militarum's infantry regiments remains their huge and expendable mass of manpower. It is the combined firepower of Astra Militarum regiments that ultimately makes them a deadly opponent, capable of out-shooting almost any enemy. The thundering charge of a thousand Guardsmen can overwhelm the most elite and dangerous of opponents, crushing them underfoot and running them through with a wall of bayonet points.",

Yet they are not deployed idly, for every Aeldari life is a precious thing, not to be squandered in pyrrhic victories or needless last stands.\nTo tip the odds further in their favour, Guardians go to battle supported by anti-gravitic weapons platforms whose crews have a mandate to vanquish priority targets in a storm of firepower. Should a foe draw too near, Guardian Defenders make a fighting retreat, for their weapons are designed for accuracy on the move.\nWhen an Aeldari Guardian dons his war mask, his former life is supplanted by the thrill of battle. Thoughts of peace and tranquillity are replaced with the desire to destroy his foes and secure glorious victory.",

Though they have set down their war masks to walk a new Path, when necessity calls, they can put it back on and once more use the deadly melee skills they once honed to perfection.\nArmed with Shuriken Pistols and razor-sharp blades, they wade into the press of enemy ranks, hewing open flesh in vivid sprays of gore. However, unlike the clumsy butchery of the other starfaring species of the galaxy, there is a beautiful violence to the way the Storm Guardians despatch their foes.\nStorm Guardian squads are a rare sight, but effective nonetheless, acting as assault troops in support of the Craftworld's Aspect Warriors. Although they lack the protection afforded by Aspect Armour, they fight with all the skill and grace of their kind.\nWith preternatural speed, their weapons sweep into the foe, chopping through limbs and joints before their adversaries can take a heavy toll in return. Storm Guardian squads invariably need to move fast, sprinting from one hotly contested strongpoint to another, and thus they forego the use of heavy weapon platforms.",

Typically recruiting from Aeldari with piloting skills from their civilian life, these pilots form a close bond with their vehicles.\nThese units are commonly assigned as forward scouts for the main Eldar host or as a rapid-response force, using their weapons to strike down the enemy as they speed past them in a brightly coloured blur. A common tactic for Jetbike riders is to circumvent enemy lines completely and then close in on their vulnerable rear, taking a fearsome toll before gunning their engines and speeding off again.\nTo an Aeldari, the mastery of the Jetbike is an exhilarating challenge. Jetbikes have long, curved vanes on either side that allow the rider to execute incredibly sharp turns in mid-air, and the strength of their anti-grav motors can be subtly manipulated to send the Jetbikes hurtling into a steep dive or sharp climb. Even for an Aeldari it takes years of practice to master a Jetbike's potential, but one who does so may build a rapport with his steed comparable to the horsemasters of Aeldari Mythology.\nGuardian Windriders are mounted upon Aeldari Jetbikes.",

    "description": "The Dire Avengers were the first amongst the Aspect Warriors of the Aeldari. They represent the Aeldari War God Khaela Mensha Khaine in his aspect as the noblest and yet most merciless of warriors. The Dire Avengers show no mercy to their foes and are unwavering in their devotion to their people.\nThese warriors are the least specialised and the most tactically flexible of all the Warrior Aspects, as they serve Aeldari armies as elite infantry. The Dire Avengers are also the most common of the Warrior Aspects amongst the Aeldari, and their shrines are the largest to be found on all the Craftworlds.\nIt is to the Dire Avengers that the Farseers turn for the most important missions. When an ancient Aeldari relic needs to be recovered or an abandoned Webway portal needs to be defended, Dire Avengers are often sent to carry out the task. When a human or Ork colony is discovered upon a Maiden World, Dire Avengers are sent to clear the trespassers. On those occasions when a Farseer has need to meet with agents of the Imperium of Man, it is the Dire Avengers who accompany him as an honour guard.\nDire Avengers are patient and methodical warriors, as furious in attack as they are intractable in defence. They possess an uncanny ability to read the ebb and flow of a battle, in much the same way as a sailor might read the sea, riding its waves, and harnessing its power to overwhelm a foe. One moment they might unleash a hail of fire before plunging forwards into the enemy lines, weapons drawn, whilst the next they might be falling back, luring their foe into a carefully prepared ambush.",

Fire Dragons are aggressive and warlike close combat fighters who utilise heat-based weaponry to destroy enemy armoured vehicles and drive the foe from his fortified strongpoints.\nThey have an unsurpassed mastery of their chosen and highly dangerous weapons and take savage delight in the devastation they create. For this reason, the Asuryani believe that the Fire Dragons are the embodiment of the Aeldari war god Kaela Mensha Khaine's penchant for pure destruction.

These swift warriors are fearsome melee combat specialists who draw their inspiration from the unearthly creature with which they share a name.\nWhat Howling Banshees lack in brute strength they make up for with their uncanny and inhuman precision and efficiency. The piercing war cry of these Aspect Warriors has heralded the coming doom of countless enemies of the Aeldari people.\nA notable exception in the otherwise genderless meritocracy that is the society of the Asuryani, the Howling Banshees are almost always female. This is because the banshees of Aeldari legend, the daughters of the Crone Goddess Morai-Heg, are themselves always female spirits. However, there do exist several males amongst the ranks of the Banshees. These rare individuals are welcomed equally into the Aspect by their sisters-in-arms if they prove able to master the varied demands of the Aspect. No matter the gender of the warrior wearing the mask, the identity of the war-mask itself is female.",

Just as these birds of legend contained the spirit of a murdered Aeldari, hovering over their killers as a mark of guilt, so too do the Swooping Hawks fly across the battlefield, dealing swift death as retribution to the enemies of the Aeldari.\nThe Swooping Hawks are among the most mobile of the Aspect Warriors because of their Swooping Hawk Wings, which allow them to lift off into the air at a moment's notice and fly across the battlefield. Their wings are made from vibrating feather plates and incorporate small gravitic lifters. When the Hawks fly, these wings vibrate with such speed they turn into a blur of colour.\nThe speed and agility that this technology provides the Swooping Hawks more than makes up for the fact that their Aspect Armour, compared to that worn by the warriors of the other Aspects, is less thick because of their need to keep their weight low and therefore offers less protection from enemy fire.",

    "description": "The Warp Spiders are Aeldari Aspect Warriors who specialise in the use of a personal teleportation device built into their Aspect Armour to make a series of rapid jumps through the Immaterium that make them nearly impossible to target and allow them to attack the enemy suddenly and disappear before he can strike back.\nThis enables them to make totally unexpected attacks on their foes, though it does necessitate spending a short time unshielded in the Empyrean. For this reason, the Warp Spiders are considered the bravest of all Aspect Warriors—they risk not only their lives in the name of victory, but also their souls, as Slaanesh hungers for the souls of all Aeldari who dare to enter the realm of \"She Who Thirsts\" unprotected. Despite this accolade, Warp Spiders are also regarded as strange and terrifying, the furthest removed from the normal Aeldari mindset of all the Warrior Aspects. Warp Spiders also tend to have a bleak outlook on life, and rarely mix with the warriors from the other Aspect Shrines.\nThe ritual armament of the Warp Spider is the Death Spinner; a highly advanced weapon that extrudes a thick cloud of razor-sharp monofilament wire. The Spinner's magnetic containment field then spools the wire together and hurls it toward the enemy. The wire's own tension causes it to writhe and lash, and where it touches flesh or soft tissue, it slices through the victim's body, causing an agonising and quite messy death.",

These weapons eject a single rigid strand of monomolecular wire that punches through armour and recoils in a tight spiral.

They specialise in the use of highly destructive, long-range heavy weaponry.\nTheir sacred weapon is the Reaper Launcher, a long-barrelled missile weapon that can create a blistering firestorm of small missiles with a single salvo. The small armour-piercing missiles the Reaper Launcher fires are powerful enough to take down all but the most heavily protected of foes.\nThe Dark Reapers pride themselves on their accuracy. To absorb the recoil of firing the Launcher and maintain a steady firing position, the powered limb supports include lower leg armour and boots fitted with stabilisers and clamps to secure the Dark Reaper to the ground. Their helmet incorporates specialised range-finding sensor vanes which extends out of the helmet of their Aspect Armour and allows a Dark Reaper to achieve target lock on even fast-moving vehicles.\nThis also creates a mind-link with the Dark Reaper's weapon, allowing them to \"see\" out of the muzzle of the launcher. The resulting increase in their already deadly accuracy means it is almost impossible for a Dark Reaper to miss his target. Their superb aim enables them to dominate the battlefield, pinning down enemy forces and destroying their chosen targets at will.",

The Shining Spears possess a bright and clear virtue that marks each one out as a warrior hero and a champion of the Aeldari race. Aeldari mythology is replete with examples of noble heroes at one with their steed and in the Shining Spears, the glories of legend are made manifest once more.\nIn battle, they fight as the Spear of Kaela Mensha Khaine, the invincible weapon of the Aeldari God of War that struck like lightning and killed any foe with a single blow. Shining Spears can be distinguished from all the other Aeldari Warrior Aspects for they are the only Aspect Warriors to make use of anti-gravity Jetbikes.\nEven a small unit of Shining Spears can turn the tide of a protracted combat, for their legendary charges hit home with the force of a thunderbolt. Apart from the twin-linked Shuriken Catapults incorporated into their Jetbikes, the ritual armament of the Shining Spears Aspect Warrior is the Laser Lance.\nThis elegant weapon can deliver intense short ranged energy blasts, and is usually used just as the Shining Spears deliver their charge.\nShining Spears are mounted upon Aeldari Jetbikes.",

Instead of the usual ritual armament, they utilise a more potent version of the Laser Lance known as a Star Lance, or even fine powered cavalry sabres called Paragon Sabres. The Exarch's secret knowledge and supernatural abilities also allow Exarchs to enhance the abilities of the Shining Spears squads they lead.\nUnder the guidance of their Exarch, a Shining Spears squad can deliver devastating hit-and-run attacks, careening past their foe and returning for another attack in much the same way as the duelling Dragon Knights of the Exodite worlds.\nShining Spear Exarchs are mounted upon Aeldari Jetbikes.

A Farseer was once a Warlock but has now become lost upon the Path of the Seer forever in the same way as the Exarchs are wed eternally to the Path of the Warrior.\nA council of the most powerful Farseers generally governs a craftworld. Farseers possess a wide diversity of psychic specialities with divination and precognition being the most common skill.\nThey are most often known for using their vast psychic powers to see the possibilities of the future so that they can manipulate events to better ensure the survival of the Aeldari species in the wake of the Fall.\nOn occasion a powerful Seer will receive a portent of some calamitous event and be able to steer the Asuryani away from disaster and doom. With so few Aeldari remaining, the Seers attempt to preserve every Aeldari life possible.\nFarseers are amongst the most powerful of Seers and probably represent some of the most potent psykers in the entire galaxy. Every craftworld has a handful of Farseers amongst their populace who usually make up that craftworld's guiding council.\nMuch of a Farseer's time is spent in a trance-like state where their spirit roams at will throughout the wraithbone of the craftworld where they direct the psychic-energy flow throughout the entire world-ship.",

    "description": "A Spiritseer is an Eldar psyker who walks the Path of the Seer in a way that allows them to commune with the souls of the dead Eldar preserved in the Craftworld's Infinity Circuit. In times of peace, the Spiritseers serve as a bridge between the living and the dead, ensuring the wisdom of the past remains available to those still able to influence the present. In time of war, the Spiritseers entreat the souls of the dead to empower Wraithguard and Wraithlord constructs, using the dead to protect their living kindred.\nThe Path of the Spiritseer is one of the most difficult of Paths to walk for an Eldar. Like all variations of the Path of the Seer, it requires the Eldar to call on their psychic powers with all the risks that usage entails. The Spiritseer must possess a mental discipline and fortitude beyond compare, for communing with the dead is extremely taxing. Depending on the spirit's past life and manner of death, it might be cooperative, but often is either unresponsive, racked with grief, jealous of the still living or even malicious. The Spiritseer must adapt themselves to commune with the intended spirit without being refused or even worse, possessed.\nAnother, more subtle danger of this Path is that the Spiritseer must be self-possessed enough to always ask and never demand assistance from the dead, no matter how dire his and his people's need might be. Making demands of the dead, forcing them to serve the will of the living, is a practice considered anathema amongst the Eldar, who view it with the same loathing that humans reserve for necromancy. It is for this reason that many Eldar view Spiritseers with some suspicion.\nAlthough the line between spiritseeing and necromancy is sometimes fine, the Spiritseer must always remain aware that the dead must only give assistance to the living willingly. The combined pressures of resisting the dead and enduring the cultural censure of the living makes the Path of the Spiritseer an uneasy road that few Eldar dare walk.",

Aroused from his throne of smouldering iron, the Avatar leads the warriors of his Craftworld to battle. Huge and all-powerful, the Avatar is a god incarnate, the embodiment of the Aeldari racial soul, and a deadly opponent even for the mightiest powers of Chaos.\nIt is said that after the birth of the Chaos God Slaanesh, She Who Thirsts, during the Fall of the Aeldari in the 30th Millennium, she fought and killed the ancient Aeldari gods one-by-one in the Immaterium, absorbing their essences into her own just as she had the souls of the Aeldari themselves. But the God of War and Strife, Khaela Mensha Khaine, was too strong to be destroyed forever. So Khaine's spirit fled the Warp and found refuge dispersed among the Infinity Circuits, the psychoreactive Wraithbone hearts of the remaining Aeldari Craftworlds.\nWherever his essence landed, a Wraithbone artefact in the form of a great statue of the god was created, allowing future Aeldari to be able to summon a fragment of the spirit of Khaine back into the Materium to defend his race when a Craftworld faces a particularly dire crisis.",

Before the Fall of Cadia in ca. 999.M41 during the 13th Black Crusade, Eldrad was already over 10,000 Terran years old, and he was amongst the foremost of Ulthwe's Seers even when the Fall was a recent wound.\nAmong Eldrad's accomplishments are supposedly: igniting the Second War for Armageddon to spare the precious lives of 10,000 Asuryani, igniting the Sanapan Scouring, the Mortis Annihilation and the Third Coming of Orian, as well as an attempt to warn the Imperium of Man of Horus' treachery even before the Horus Heresy had begun.\nUlthran was responsible for warning the Asuryani of Iyanden of the coming of Hive Fleet Kraken and partially awakening the Aeldari god of the dead Ynnead during the Battle of Port Demesnus.\nThis latter deed led directly to the Night of Revelations in Commorragh and the birth of the Ynnari faction, which Ulthran staunchly supports as he believes they represent his species' only chance for salvation against the predations of Slaanesh.",

The greatest of his students went on to establish their own Aspect shrines and became Phoenix Lords themselves. Soon after the inception of the Aspect Shrines, the Hand of Asuryan vanished, but tales of his deeds continue to be reported. Experiencing various deaths but being reborn again thanks to his armor, notably at the hands of the Keeper of Secrets N'Kari, he has been rumored slaying the agents of Chaos in the Eye of Terror to the Eastern Fringe.

The eventual fate of Fuegan is foretold in the last stanza of the Asuryata, the legend of the Phoenix Lords, known in full only to the Bards of Twilight.\nFuegan learned the arts of war in the Shrine of Asur, under the eyes of Asurmen in that distant time, many Terran millennia ago, when the Warrior Aspects were first born. When the Asurya made their way across the galaxy, it was Fuegan who founded the shrines of the Fire Dragon upon the craftworlds -- the Warrior Aspect whose teachings advocate the utter annihilation of the enemy so that their demise is assured beyond all doubt.",

It rode out the initial psychic shockwaves that destroyed the Eldar realms but was subsequently caught in the fringes of the Eye of Terror. Although the Eldar of Altansar fought valiantly against the encroachment of Chaos, they were unable to escape their inevitable doom. Within five hundred years of the Fall their Craftworld was swallowed whole into the Warp. The only soul that escaped the clutches of this roiling Warp Storm was Maugan Ra, the Harvester of Souls -- the mightiest of Altansar's Exarchs and the first of the Dark Reapers.\nWhen Asurmen first taught his brethren the arts of war and trained the first Phoenix Lords in the days immediately after the Fall, it was Maugan Ra that fell furthest from the fold. He fashioned baroque weapons of occult nature; not the blades of his brethren but dark and malefic artefacts that could slay his foes from afar. As his craft progressed, Maugan Ra learnt that even the mightiest weapon could be wielded with surgical precision. This discovery, and his mastery of each of the diverse facets of ranged combat, led to the creation of the deadly Maugetar, loosely translated as the \"Harvester,\" a potent Shuriken Cannon fitted with an in-built Executioner Power Weapon and later to the disciplines of the Dark Reaper Aspect itself.",

He is known to different Ranger bands by many different titles; the Sentinel of the Stars, the Wayforger, the Shield of Alaitoc, and he cares little which name is used. A master of the Webway's geography on a level that only the Harlequins surpass, it is said by the Eldar that he can arrive unheralded upon any planet, stepping through its Webway Portal with ease. Indeed, some say that he knows too much.\nOver the centuries, Illic's knowledge has benefited Alaitoc and its brother Craftworlds greatly, having guided many Eldar warhosts through the paths of the Webway to do battle on faraway worlds and arriving to turn the tide of battle. In addition, his skill and accuracy with a Ranger Longrifle is unparalleled and many an Ork Warboss, Necron Overlord, Chaos Champion, and Imperial Guard General have met their end at his gaze.\nHowever, Illic has walked the Path of the Outcast for so long that it is no longer clear if he can ever leave it. Thus, he wanders the galaxy, pursuing some hidden agenda that his acolytes whisper is the only thing staving off the Rhana Dandra. He has fought against the rise of the Necrons, sought out lost Seerstones, and many say he seeks to transcend the mortal plane altogether. Despite his mysteries, he has nonetheless attracted a loyal following of Eldar Pathfinders.",

During the Battle of the Burning Moon, all of Arienal's family save herself were killed in the Chaos Cyclonic Torpedo attack. Thereafter, Arienal embraced the ways of the Spiritseer, and her mind was ever connected to the Infinity Circuit to commune with those that she had lost. When Eldrad Ulthran brought warning to Iyanden of the Great Devourer, he also told the Iyanden Seer Council that the Eldar race's only ultimate hope against Slaanesh lay with Ynnead, the god of the dead. While most of Iyanden dismissed Ulthran, Arienal embraced this prophecy.\nArienal's followers have been no less active than the famed Prince Yriel, throwing their hopes into the ancient prophecy known as the Phoenix Arisen; wherein the Eldar race will be reborn anew. At Iyanna's direction, they have sought the Tears of Morai-Heg, gemstone fragments that possess ancient magic that Spiritseers say would see the rebirth accomplished. Their search for the tears has brought them into contact with humans, Orks, and other primitive races. Reclaiming these tears has proven a bloody affair and taking possession of the first required a dozen worlds left in ruin. Within a few short years, Iyanna's followers had grown so influential that they had outgrown Yriel's.\nAfter the Battle of Duriel, many assumed Iyanna dead as she had been alongside Taec Silvereye at the time of the planet's destruction. However, this fear proved to be unfounded as she was discovered among the wounded. She later reappeared to help save Iyanden from Daemonic invasion, allying with the Ynnari.",

Their savage nature makes them a popular addition to the courts of many Dark Eldar Archons.\nAn Ur-Ghul is a very efficient hunter despite its lack of any discernible vision senses, able to track its quarry for kilometres using an easy looping gait that covers long distances with low effort. Once it is ready, the Ur-Ghul's speed is unnatural. It rapidly becomes a fury of claws and teeth as it tears its prey into gobbets of flesh.",

In fact, their masks contain complex sonic emitters and pheromone traps that can partially control the beasts, although all Beastmasters, even unmasked, have a natural ability to dominate lower creatures.\nBeastmasters will gladly accompany Dark Eldar raids into Realspace, driving their herds of beasts into a bloodlust using whips and lures as they hover safely above the frenzy upon modified skyboards.",

They are soldiers outfitted with a wide variety of advanced technology. Fire Warriors are known to be efficient, professional, but cautious fighters. Often deployed from a Devilfish APC, they can rapidly deploy and lay down withering barrages of fire against their foes. The basic team is made up of six Fire Warriors, but it is not uncommon for them to contain up to twelve including a Shas'ui team leader, as well as drone support.\n\nThe Breacher Team is a type of T'au Fire Warrior deployment. The Fire Warriors Breacher Team specializes in brutally effective close-range assaults, clearing buildings of threats in a tight, tactical formation and delivering sharp, shockingly sudden frontline displays of raw incendiary power that grind enemy soldiers into dust, discharging Pulse Blasters and hurling Photon Grenades until they are certain every path is clear.",

Cadre Fireblades are excellent field leaders and their long experience at war has taught them exactly where to place shots to maximise damage, and fire with pinpoint accuracy. It is on the firing line that Cadre Fireblades really comes into their own. There, they radiate a steadying calm, directing their Fire Warriors to maintain accurate fire no matter the circumstances, instilling each T'au trooper with the precision and efficiency that is the hallmark of thousands of Terran years of martial training.\n\nWhether breaking the impetus of an advancing horde of Ork Greenskins or seeking to bring down the heavily armoured Space Marines of the Imperium, no one knows a Fire Warrior's strength better than a Cadre Fireblade. A Cadre Fireblade will always extol a focus upon what they believe to be the T'au's primary military strength -- overwhelming infantry firepower! Theirs is the ability to drive and direct Fire Warriors as they pour volley after volley of merciless pulse fire onto the target.\n\nExperts in the standard Fire Caste tactical doctrine as laid down in the Code of Fire, Cadre Fireblades will also instruct all warriors nearby to fight closely together, with each member of a team doing his utmost to protect not just his comrades, but also nearby teams in his cadre. All teams then provide mutual support on the battlefield when the enemy launches a major assault, helping to annihilate the foe with mutually reinforcing fields of overlapping firepower.",

The mobile variants of Tau Drones exist in the form of sleek disk-shaped machines which are well-armoured and equipped with small anti-gravitic engines and manoeuvring jet-thrusters so that they can hover and skim across the ground. As they hover over landscapes, rotating back and forth, their sensor vane constantly transmits vital information about their surroundings.\n\nThese types of Drones are commonly seen alongside the warriors of the Fire Caste, but similar designs can be found buzzing through the streets and skies of any T'au settlement. Although small and innocuous, those foes that underestimate Tau Drones often pay for such a costly mistake with their lives. In addition, Drone intelligences can also be found built into a great number of technologies developed by the Tau Earth Caste, giving a simple synthetic intellect to a wide array of devices.\n\nThere are many different types of Drones utilised by the Tau in varying roles; these can range from mundane civilian uses to multiple combat roles. Tau Drones can carry a wide variety of equipment, ranging from defensive Shield Generators to offensive weaponry, communications equipment, and various combat support systems. Most Tau Drones can interact with their Tau masters, obeying simple instructions and even anticipating what duties are required of them. The Tau value their Drones, and whilst they are not regarded as having equal status to a Tau, they are treated with a degree of respect akin to that of a favoured animal companion amongst humans.",

Above him float the rest of his team—a group of Sniper Drones, each of them equipped with an underslung Longshot Pulse Rifle. The Longshot Pulse Rifle is a lethal weapon that can send its plasma pulse over a great distance. A well-placed shot is capable of taking out any target, and there are many accounts of Sniper Drone Teams single-handedly throwing enemy forces into disarray with their ability to rain down sniper fire from long range or clear skies. As a result, Sniper Drone Teams are a deadly addition to any cadre as they are adept at picking off enemy leaders or eliminating key infantrymen, such as those carrying heavy weapons.\n\nAlthough the Sniper Drones are equipped with impressive artificial intelligence, it is the Firesight Marksman, a Shas'la, who is the brains behind the operation. They are masked by a small stealth field generator, meaning that they can secret themselves into dense terrain where they will blend in, minimising the threat of return fire. The marksman is equipped with a drone uplink, with which they command their deadly charges, seeking out the most vulnerable quarry, and a markerlight to mark priority targets for both the drones and the rest of the Cadre.",

    "description": "The XV15 Stealthsuit is the smallest of all the various T'au Battlesuit variants and is designed for use in operations requiring a high degree of stealth. Fire Warriors serving in a Stealth Team specialise in covert operations such as infiltration, sabotage, reconnaissance and ambush. Stealth Teams are essentially the Fire Caste's special operations units. They are the \"lone wolves\" of the T'au military, typically operating independently of their Hunter Cadre. Suddenly appearing, as if stepping out from nowhere, a Stealth Team unleashes a hail of gunfire to cripple or eliminate their selected targets. Theirs is a secretive way of war, as they infiltrate enemy lines, seeking vulnerable targets to destroy. In order to pass unseen into enemy territory, Stealth Teams use light-bending disruption technology embedded in their sleek Battlesuits to camouflage themselves. Additional cloaking fields deaden sound and shield them from heat-detecting sensors, allowing them to penetrate deep into hostile regions before launching precisely timed ambushes.\n\nThe XV15 Stealthsuit is designed to be worn by a single member of the Fire Caste and is the smallest of all the various Battlesuit variants of the T'au: a T'au in an XV15 Stealthsuit is hardly larger than a Fire Warrior in standard T'au Combat Armour; even though it offers far greater protection. XV15 Stealthsuits are currently being phased out of mainstream use and being replaced by the XV25 Stealthsuit.",

XV25 Stealthsuits are significantly smaller than the XV8 Crisis Battlesuits, and, because of this, carry less weaponry. What Stealthsuits lack in firepower, however, they more than make up for with the ability to move almost unseen by the enemy until the very last instant. XV25 Stealthsuits are a relatively recent development of the T'au Earth Caste and shares many of the same features of its predecessor in the T'au armoury, the XV15 Stealthsuit.\n\nXV25 Stealthsuits differ from XV15 Stealthsuits mainly through the additional space provided due to the slightly larger and bulkier form of the suit.

All T'au Commanders possess the authority to lead a Hunter Cadre into combat. A T'au Commander is a hero of the T'au Empire -- he has dedicated his life utterly to the pursuit of the Greater Good. Each is wise and insightful, and an inspirational figure to his troops, whilst also being a battle-scarred warrior and a supremely dangerous foe to the enemies of the T'au.\n\nThe XV86 Coldstar Battlesuit is a variant of the XV85 Enforcer. Made for Tau Commanders, the XV86 is covered in fins which streamline it, allowing super-fast movement across the theatre of battle, annihilating enemies with sharp shocks from its burst cannon. The on-board Holophoton Countermeasures and telemetry suites feed the Coldstar and its Commander pilot a massive variety of information that would overwhelm the untrained mind - instead, in this case, it allows the Coldstar Battlesuit to soar over its foes with a grace that enemy targeting systems simply cannot hope to catch.",

Born to counsel, advise and steer their comrades towards the chosen path, the Ethereals embody the roles of royalty and the priesthood, and the deference paid to them is the closest thing to mysticism in T'au society.\n\nFor weighty decisions, a wise Ethereal will take counsel from the senior members of each caste, although ultimate sovereignty falls upon him and him alone. The Ethereals find themselves in a binding role -- guiding the other castes to work together for the Greater Good. Their unique role is a combination of spiritual and political command, and their declarations shape and steer every facet of the T'au Empire in an indisputably complete way. An Ethereal must be a consummate leader and motivator in every way: pushing the Earth Caste for more practical innovations, setting firm negotiation goals for the Water Caste to strive for, giving perimeters to the great fleets of the Air Caste and directing the sometimes-overzealous aggression of the Fire Caste.",

However, more significantly, they play a vital role within Kroot society which shapes the fate of the entire species.\n\nThe Kroot have at some distant point in their past gained the ability to absorb the genetic characteristics of their prey, inheriting many of their physiological and anatomical features. This is achieved by way of the Kroot's unique DNA, which is able to store far more information than that of other species, allowing them to incorporate useful DNA strands into their own genotype in Lamarckian fashion.\n\nIt is the task of the Shaper to oversee this process. Shapers have the instinctive ability to sample and analyse the genetic characteristics of any creature they eat. They are able to isolate the prey's DNA so that it does not corrupt their own and interpret which of its characteristics might be favourable to Kroot evolution and which might be detrimental.",

    "description": "The XV104 Riptide Battlesuit is one of the latest T'au Earth Caste innovations, designed to combat the most dangerous enemies of the T'au Empire. Powered by an experimental Dark Matter Nova Reactor and equipped with an arsenal of highly advanced weapon systems, the XV104 Riptide is the pinnacle of T'au Battlesuit technology. Standing twice the height of an XV8 Crisis Battlesuit, its long, back-jointed legs hold up a heavily armoured torso that houses the Riptide's Dark Matter Nova Reactor—an experimental power generator that can be activated should the Shas'vre pilot require extra power to sustain his heavy rate of fire.\n\nA Riptide's pilot is an elite Shas'vre—chosen to don the mightiest Battlesuit and fight for his Cadre mates; he is an exemplar amongst his peers. On the battlefield, a Riptide can jet quickly to plug gaps in T'au lines and give covering fire for its colleagues whilst shielding its allies with its armoured bulk.",

These robotic Scarabs are the most numerous and diverse of the Necrons' Canoptek machine servants. They are designed to break down organic and non-organic matter into raw energy, which can then be woven into fresh construct forms at the direction of the Scarabs' controller.\n\nEssentially mindless feeding and replication machines of various sizes and functions, their swift, darting movements and their high-pitched chittering mimic in form and behaviour organic invertebrates but, directed by the will of a Cryptek or slaved to the more complex artificial intelligence of a Canoptek Spyder, they are capable of staggering feats of construction and destruction. It is for this latter function they are used by the Necron Lords as weapons of war -- an all-devouring tide of skittering metal launched ahead of a Necron phalanx that can break down tanks and fortifications and force an enemy to expend its firepower in frantic efforts to halt the onslaughts.\n\nHowever, Canoptek Scarabs lack a true hive mind. A swarm of Scarabs has no more true intelligence than one Scarab alone—which is to say none. All they are driven by are simple instructions and even simpler instincts. Nevertheless, their highly sophisticated auto-routines and construct-patterns allow them to build Necron weapons and vehicles of immense power in a surprisingly brief time. Canoptek Scarabs are fearsome enemies in swarms due to their horrifying nature as mindless feeding machines.",

They were created from the majority of the ancient humanoid Necrontyr species who agreed to be bound to the will of their Star Gods, the terrible entities known as the C'tan. The Necrontyr's consciousnesses were transferred into robotic bodies made of the living metal called necrodermis. Over a long period of time, the new unliving bodies dulled the Necrontyr's minds and their abilities to feel emotion or pleasure. Over many millennia, the ultimate outcome of this process of gradual desensitization was that the Necron Warriors became little more than soulless automatons, the warrior-slaves of the still-sentient Necron royalty and military elite who seek to rebuild their star-spanning empires across the portions of the galaxy now controlled by the \"lesser races.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of Necron Warriors form the cold heart of a Tomb World's armies. They are implacable, emotionless, and terrifying soldiers -- the inexorable emissaries of death itself. Yet on closer inspection of a Necron Warrior, aberrant details become visible that act against the image of the inevitable reaper. Its reactions, though precise, are slow. Its limbs, though strong and sleek, are pitted and corroded, covered with an oily fluid seeping from aged joints. Its movements are jerky, and every so often it struggles as corroded and eons-old engrammatic synapses misfire.\n\nGrim and remorseless machine-creatures, each Necron Warrior carries the dimly echoed remains of a living mind bound into eternal servitude. They are implacable and ruthless killers, largely ignorant of their own nightmarish condition. But despite their shambolic gait, they are all but unstoppable; their bodies able to repair almost any harm done to them and compelled by the will of their lords, they are tireless as agents of destruction.",

These were the very elite of the Necrontyr armies and are the true fighting strength of the Necron dynasties; hardened veterans of ancient wars born anew in tireless, undying necrodermis bodies.\n\nStill able to think and respond with a chill echo of intelligence, their martial power remains undimmed, as does their unflagging loyalty. Within the engrammic circuitry of each Immortal, there lingers a spark of the mortal soldier he once was. Though heavily suppressed by the obedience protocols of his master, an Immortal can remember the triumph of the kill and the pleasure of humbling its foes. The transition from mortal flesh to undying alien metal has only deepened the Immortals' hatred of their enemies. Stripped of weaknesses such as remorse and pity, and bereft of any fear of death, an Immortal kills without hesitation.\n\nFor hundreds of Terran years, the Immortals were a scourge upon all who stood between the Necrons and galactic domination. Now, the Immortal legions are but an echo of what they once were, for countless trillions were destroyed in the final days of the War in Heaven. Yet billions more survived, and now wait only to be awakened from their Tomb Worlds to begin the reconquest of the galaxy for the Necrons.",

Flayed Ones act as specialised close combat troops. They appear from an unknown pocket dimension of their hideous kind to join the Necron armies in battle, though never by invitation from the Necrons themselves.\n\nThese loathsome creatures were once Necrontyr who managed to retain some of their original consciousness when they were transferred into their living metallic bodies of necrodermis, but were cursed with a terrible disease, manifesting a hunger for flesh that cannot be satisfied and that eventually drove them to madness.\n\nAdvancing before a Necron force, these stooped yet terrifyingly agile automatons excel at infiltrating and spreading terror like a plague within the ranks of their foes. They are quite capable melee fighters and make use of flensing blades that extend from their fingers and can flay a man alive in seconds. Thin and wiry, they habitually adorn themselves with the still-wet pieces of skin and hide they have stripped from their victims, leaving behind the skinned corpses to sow fear and confusion.\n\nIn such a state they are a terrifying sight to behold, so much so that enemy combatants lose their nerve when they see pieces of old squad-mates hanging from the undying machines approaching their lines. This is further amplified by the gloom and mist that follows them from the charnel dimensions they dwell within between battles.",

Like most Necrons, the Deathmarks' technology lies far beyond the realm of human comprehension and they can effectively phase in and out of normal space-time at will.\n\nTheir victims will assume that they have been ambushed and that the Deathmarks teleported onto the battlefield. The reality is that they were already there, waiting out of phase for just the right moment to slaughter their victims. Few enemy commanders encounter Deathmarks and live to tell the tale.\n\nIn appearance, Deathmarks are more akin to Necron Immortals in the craftsmanship of their mechanical bodies. They are distinguished by a single, large green-glowing optic sensor and the arcane orbs projecting from their spines. These orbs flare with an unnatural light as a Deathmark utilises its occult powers. In keeping with their role, Deathmarks display a propensity for stealth that is all but unique amongst the Necron ranks.",

    "description": "A Psychomancer is a Cryptek who specialises in understanding and manipulating the minds of others. Their science influences synaptic patterns and neurochemical reactions, as well as conjuring holographic phantasms which play upon the primal fears and atavistic reflexes of lesser beings.\n\nPsychomancers are also known as Harbingers of Despair, and they are employed not only for their keen insights into the minds of the enemy, but for their ability to shatter morale and sow terror during battle.\n\nIn battle, the floating Psychomancers shroud themselves in holo-illusions and neurostatic phantasms that make them, and the other Necrons nearby, appear nightmarish spectres of death. No two individuals will see this 'nightmare shroud' the same way, for it draws upon the unique fears and basic animal dread of each viewer to shape their own personal vision of terror.",

    "description": "A C'tan Shard is all that remains of the once mighty Star Gods of Necron antiquity. They are now only echoes of their former selves, splinters of energy that survived their Necron servants' ancient betrayal and were enslaved in turn.\n\nThe Deceiver, also known as Mephet'ran or Mephet'ran the Deceiver, is the C'tan or Necron Star God of trickery, lies, manipulation, and deception. Many millions of standard years ago, it was the Deceiver that presented himself before the ruling Necrontyr Triarch and offered the Silent King Szarekh knowledge of the biotransference process, granting the Necrontyr bodies of Necrodermis to help them fight against their ancient enemies, the Old Ones.\n\nDespite its legendary guile, in the end Mephet'ran was betrayed and tricked like his fellow C'tan by the revolting Necrons, his essence shattered into fragments, each entombed within a Tesseract Labyrinth. However, recent, scattered events hint at the fact that one or more of the C'tan Shards of the Deceiver might still be at large in the galaxy.",

Implanted with the gene-seed of the Primarchs, the Space Marines stand seven Terran feet tall, with thickened bones, two hearts, hyper-dense muscles and all manner of special organs that allow them to survive and fight in the most hostile conditions. They feel little pain and heal wounds at a remarkable rate.\n\nTheir will is hardened by constant training and fighting, and they battle with dedication and zeal, brooking no hesitation, mercy or cowardice. All of these things combine with the best weaponry and armour in the galaxy to make the Space Marines the most fearsome warriors of the Imperium.\n\nThe Chaos Space Marines have all of these strengths and skills as well, to which are added the power of Chaos and a brutal devotion to the Dark Gods. Ever since the Horus Heresy, Space Marines of every Legion and Chapter have been tempted by the path of Chaos, whether for selfish reasons or great ideals.\n\nSundered from the Imperium, having turned their backs on the Emperor, these warriors know that there can be no peace for them, neither forgiveness nor absolution. They are wholly committed to the path they now tread, for good or ill, and they can expect no quarter from former Battle-Brothers.",

Sometimes the Chosen will use their battle skills to infiltrate enemy lines and set up ambushes or outflank an enemy army to launch surprise attacks on the opposition's strongpoints.\n\nConfident in the extreme, and contemptuous even of those that march to war alongside them, the Chosen bow only to the gods themselves and to the Chaos Champions who command their allegiance.\n\nLike Chaos Champions, there are many Heretic Astartes who may be called Chosen; dedicated, deadly soldiers. Often, Chosen will band together with other such veterans and may be defined as much by the wargear they wield and the tactics they prefer as their dedication to a particular Chaos God.",

They are monstrous hybrids of Human, Daemon and machine. An Obliterator is able to absorb any weapon into its body that is held for too long. These unfortunates can spawn these weapons from their very flesh, and also grow ammunition for them. Chaos Obliterators are biologically fused to their suits of Power Armour.\n\nAs a result of their mutation, Obliterators are no longer even remotely sane. This insanity could be caused by the constant mental and physical trauma of absorbing weapons into the Obliterator's body or being biologically welded by his own body to his armour. This insanity is also possibly caused by the Machine Spirits of his weapons and armour fusing into a destructive daemonic entity after infection by the virus. Obliterators are rarely part of an existing Traitor Legion or Renegade Space Marine warband; they prefer to sell their services to the highest bidder amongst the forces of Chaos in return for access to the archaeotech that they crave.\n\nThe monstrous warriors of the Obliterator Cults amongst the Heretic Astartes are a blasphemy against nature and Machine God alike. Their forms are so altered, so thoroughly conjoined with the tools of war, that every cell in their bodies thrills with a spark of mechanical life. The technomagi of Mars dream of achieving such a symbiosis, but in truth, only their Heretek brothers in the Dark Mechanicum have mastered the complete fusion of metal and flesh.\n\nIt is only the changeling power of the Warp that allows this process to take place, melding the inert and the animate together on a spiritual level in order to form something far greater than mere cybernetics. Because of their Chaos-born powers, Obliterators are capable of not only absorbing weaponry into themselves, but also of manifesting munitions from their titanium-laced flesh.",

    "description": "A Mutilator is a vile Chaos Space Marine whose intense lust for battle and quest for the simple purity of the blade have warped his physical form until he has fused, body and soul, with his melee weaponry.\n\nThe exact origins of Mutilators is not exactly clear. It is generally believed that the first of their number were originally Terminators of the Traitor Legions who specialised in close-quarters fighting, but as with all who harbour an obsession within the Warp, they grew to become the incarnation of the murderous desires in their hearts.\n\nLike their brethren Heretic Astartes, they adopted an obsession with the Warp that mutated them into mindless killing machines, becoming one with the axes and swords that they hold dear. Those who dedicate themselves to the act of killing in melee cannot help but be affected by it.\n\nThe satisfying impact of a bludgeon smashing into an unprotected head, the yielding of flesh to the point of a blade or an axe's bloody bite -- even the most faithful Space Marine cannot deny that these acts bring a rush, or even a thrill, to the mind and body alike. A lifetime of unrelenting battle can breed a dangerous need for such acts of violence, and when that period spans several Terran centuries, the effects upon the psyche can be dramatic.\n\nFor those who seek refuge in the Immaterium, this psychosis is magnified beyond all reason. Such warriors might begin their descent into madness by constant maintenance of their weapons in between battle, by chaining themselves to their favoured wargear, or by outright refusing to let go of their favoured tools of war under any circumstances. These dangerously focused individuals are easy prey for the corruption of Chaos.\n\nBefore long, a warrior who yearns too much for the visceral charms of battle may find that he has fused with his weapons, the blade becoming part of him as a hand would be to a normal man. Over time, these assault specialists come to identify more with their weaponry than with their fellow Battle-Brothers. Disillusioned by the fickle nature of Mankind, they instead strive for the simple purity of the blade. As the years take their toll, such individuals leave their humanity behind altogether, becoming living weapons.",

Those who offer themselves up for possession usually spend solar months in rituals of debasement and scarification, offering up blood sacrifices and preparing their bodies to harbour a daemonic entity.\n\nThough the personalities of these half-mad supplicants are subsumed forever within the power of the possessing Daemon, mass possessions are nonetheless great celebrations for the devotees of Chaos of the spiritual union between mortal and Daemon, material and Empyrean.

These qualities mean that Ogryns make exceptional shock troops and are often deployed on the front lines of battle by Imperial commanders.\nOn the other hand, Ogryns are known for their inability to understand complex commands and tactics. This simple-mindedness has also contributed to the big Abhumans' reputation as being notoriously easy to corrupt to the service of Chaos. These simplistic Abhumans dwell on worlds far from the Emperor's light, and often fall into the worship of the Ruinous Powers. The servants of Chaos also sometimes forcibly conscript Ogryns into their ranks.\nKnown as Ogryn Brutes, the servants of the Dark Gods will utilise crude surgical procedures, forbidden combat drugs and sorcerous rituals in order to control the beasts and set them upon their enemies.",

They constantly fight amongst themselves when not on the hunt or at war. Their herds are merely a grouping of warriors led by a powerful Beastlord.\nThey have superior hunting skills, strength and endurance compared to other Beastmen, and are convinced that the gods of Chaos favour them.

Beyond simpler signs of mutation are grotesqueries such as insectoid claws, tentacles or fanged maws where no mouth ought to be.\n\nRampant growth of meat and bone can create twelve-foot-high monstrosities whose fists are capable of bending plasteel, and whose mass can absorb bolt shells that would fell an ordinary person. There have also been many recorded instances of mutants whose flesh has melded with machinery or other inorganic technology, often through the reality-warping power of Chaos.\n\nYet it is not just the appearance or abilities of mutants that rankles the right-minded citizens of the Imperium, for those whose physical forms are marred by Warp energies often harbour deviant intent, spreading bloodshed and mayhem.\n\nWorse still, the most afflicted become willing pawns of the Dark Gods, foul agents of corruption actively dedicated to spreading ruin and overthrowing the Imperium.\n\nAccursed Cultist Mutants are Chaos Cultists who are heavily mutated by Chaos. More than the mere mutant dregs who populate the benighted depts and sumps of many a hive world, Accused Cultists are horrifying devotees of the Dark Gods.\n\nAccursed Cultists have myriad and terrifying origins – whether born of rituals, experimentation, or the predation of Daemons, these aberrations are herded into battle as shock troops, their tainted flesh regenerating grievous wounds with unnatural vigour. Once they reach close quarters, Mutants flail and lash at the enemy with claws or tendrils.",

So little of their humanity remains that there is little to distinguish them from Chaos Spawn.\n\nThese hideous abominations are possessed by one or many daemons, and it is impossible to tell how much of the original host remains. Each has a scroll or parchment nailed to its form, upon which are written words in evil tongues to prevent the bound daemons from fully-manifesting.\n\nAccursed Torments are often found alongside their lesser kin, towering abominations amidst teeming hordes of slavering monsters.\n\nMutation\nDuring arcane rituals, the most devoted among a Chaos Cult have evil symbols carved into their flesh or tattooed onto their skin. Should the correct words of invocation be said in battle, these icons appear to draw empyric power to them, which twists the flesh of the Devotee and horrifically mutates them. This does not satisfy the dark cravings and power lust of some. Depraved prayers are written upon flayed skin and nailed into the tormented flesh of these individuals, then daemons are summoned and bound into their mortal bodies.\n\nDuring battle, CULTIST Threats may 'mutate' as a result of the GM spending Ruin. By spending 1 Ruin at the end of a round, one of the following occurs:\nA number of Chaos Cultists equal to the game's Tier mutate into Accursed Mutants.\nA single Accursed Mutant mutates into an Accursed Torment.\nA single CULTIST Threat heals 1d3+Tier Wounds and recovers all Shock.\n\nWhen mutating into a different type of Threat, the Threat heals all Wounds and Shock. If part of a Mob, the Threats separate from the Mob (and, if their new form are also Troops, may form a new Mob immediately). When an Elite Threat mutates (or an Accursed Mutant mutates into an Accursed Torment), they may immediately roll on one of the Mutation tables in the Wrath & Glory core rulebook.",

Some of these demagogues are firebrand zealots driven by dark inspiration. Others are cruel schemers whose vile ambitions lead others into damnation.

    "description": "Chaos Hounds, also known as Warhounds of Chaos, or simply Chaos Warhounds, are large, mutated canid or lupine animals that stalk the darker parts of many worlds in search of prey. They are often rounded up by Chaos cults, Beastmen herds, and other servants of the Dark Gods as hunting beasts.\n\nThe red, glinting eyes of Chaos Warhounds peer from the treeline, and saliva pools upon the litter-strewn ground as they taste the air for the scent of their next victim. Many a lone Enforcer on night-time patrol has shivered at the sound of baleful howling in the distance, only to be confronted by the low growling of the pack of Chaos Hounds that has crept up behind him whilst he was distracted.\n\nDrawn to the lure of fresh meat, warhounds often prowl near isolated communities, searching for lone or vulnerable creatures to attack. These slinking predators have an innate kinship with Beastmen, and freely wander through the filthy and bonestrewn encampments that serve as lairs for those bestial abhumans.\n\nGradually the warhounds become as much a part of the herd as any Fellgor. Some Beastmen deliberately rear these vicious attack beasts, training them for battle, though they can never be truly tamed. Through all manner of cruel mistreatments the warhounds are conditioned to display particular characteristics, such as aggression and speed—not that they need much encouragement.",

Each is an exceptional warrior; whether they are known for their martial prowess or sheer animalistic brutality, the most elite of the Chaos Champions, known as \"Exalted Champions,\" inevitably leave a trail of corpses in their wake.\n\nIn seeking out and slaying the most vaunted of enemies, Exalted Champions hope to draw the eye of the Dark Gods. They do so with good reason -- from the perspective of a power-hungry madman, at least. Unlike so many other deities given obeisance across the galaxy, who remain distant and unknowable, if they exist at all, the Ruinous Powers of Chaos are very real entities, and willing to reward or punish their supplicants on the whim of the moment.\n\nAn Exalted Champion that proves a capable pawn in the Great Game will find themselves rewarded with abilities far beyond those of even the most accomplished mortal. Warp-given \"rewards\" usually appear first as blemishes or stigmata, then, as time passes, as strange protuberances or abilities that become ever more pronounced over the passage of time.\n\nTheir nature is sometimes suited to the recipient's personal agenda -- a bloodthirsty butcher may become possessed of insane strength, whereas a leader of warriors might find their commands obeyed without question. Other times these \"gifts\" of the Dark Gods might be hideously disfiguring, or even physically crippling, for what the Ruinous Powers consider a blessing might be seen by mortals as the vilest curse.",

These are more than idle words -- most Dark Apostles can act as direct conduits through which the Ruinous Powers can speak to mortal men.\n\nIt is not unknown for a Dark Apostle to suddenly straighten, his eyes glazing over as his mouth spits guttural and blood-flecked gibberish. Those who can understand this glottal tongue claim that it is the language of the gods themselves.\n\nThe Dark Apostles sit high in the esteem of their brethren, and their intense charisma and burning conviction inspires men to great and terrible acts. The often harsh yoke of the Imperium fosters great resentment in those of weak character, and Dark Apostles are experts at fanning those sparks into raging blazes.\n\nWhen these preachers of terrible truths infiltrate an Imperial world, hidden Chaos Cults are brought together and long-fostered alliances are brought to terrible fruition. It is never long before the bodies of Adeptus Arbites, Judges and aristocrats alike, are strung from spire and cable.",

There, the spirits of captured Imperial machines are driven to madness as their physical forms are rebuilt into bestial and terrifying new shapes.\n\nThe Warpsmiths preside over their infernal industry as pioneers of mechamorphosis, as they watch Daemon Princes thrust Lesser Daemons into the cogs of giant, mechanoid birth-factories that crank out new Daemon Engines from their cable-lined wombs. When the time for conquest is finally at hand, entire armies of these growling battle engines stomp and soar into the material world under their command, the Warpsmith's bitter ambition writ large and set loose upon the Imperium of Man.\n\nWarpsmiths tend to be obsessive characters who believe that Mankind's ambition is limited by his mortal nature. Daemons are ultimately insubstantial of form, and machines, though physically indomitable, are all but inert. Because of this, all Warpsmiths are engaged in an eternal quest to combine the strengths of all three of these elements -- mortal, daemon and machine -- whilst eradicating their weaknesses.",

The Thousand Sons sent their Librarians to other Legions teaching them to wield psychic powers to support their battle-brothers, creating the Librarius divisions that still exist to this day. As the Heresy began, many of these Librarians in the Traitor Legions started dabbling with profane warp-craft and making deals with daemons.\n\nMost Sorcerers are granted gifts by their god, which further enhance their psychic powers. They are also often selfish madmen, believing themselves superior to all others and on a mighty quest for power and knowledge to increase their mental fortitude and develop new ways of using their powers. Often the visions given to Sorcerers are unattainable, subsequently driving them to extremes in their desire to achieve these goals.\n\nSorcerers often take part in Daemonic Pacts to increase their powers through the use of Daemonic energy. This pact bargains some form of service or payment in return for a part of the Daemon's power. The Sorcerer can use this power to unleash staggering psychic powers, in the same way as Daemons use it to maintain their grip on reality. The greatest Sorcerers have dozens of daemonic pacts to increase their powers to unimaginable ends. While this can be useful and attractive, eventually a price must be paid by the Sorcerer.\n\nIn addition to their warp powers, Chaos Sorcerers remain powerful combatants, often wielding force weapons and clad in mighty armour bedecked in talismans and etched with vile runes. Some few have managed to secure ancient suits of Tactical Dreadnought Armour, also known as Terminator Armour.",

The greatest Chaos Champions become Chaos Lords and are often granted with mutations and alterations by the gods to further their cause. Chaos Lords are so powerful as to be able to bind the forces of Chaos to their will, although this often brings a dangerous position as advancement is commonly achieved through killing their leader. Some Lords lead through brute strength, others through cunning and some are maniacs bent on self-aggrandizement. Others are truly worshipers of Chaos with a zealous dedication to the dark gods.\n\nChampions often come with a mark of one of the four Chaos Gods. Champions of Khorne are savage and value physical strength and combat over cunning and strategy. Tzeentchian champions are often very knowledgeable and many of them are sorcerers. Champions of Nurgle are the most distorted and physically corrupted of Chaos' followers, their bodies dulled from pain enabling them to endure physical injury with little trauma. Slaaneshi champions are often those who seek the most intense pleasures possible and are often physically the fastest Chaos warriors due to their hyper-sensitive minds.",

In the case of Chaos Space Marines, their genetically-enhanced transhuman physiques have been made even more impressive by the protean caress of the Warp. Their wargear is often as outlandish as their physical appearance; a Chaos Lord may hack his foes apart with a massive chainaxe, blast them with an ancient combi-weapon, or slice open their vehicles with a screaming Daemon Sword.\n\nRegardless of affiliation, these conquerors of worlds invariably prefer to lead from the front.

Whether using its massive Battle Cannon to destroy entire formations or ripping apart enemies with its massive claws, this engine of war acts as a harbinger of utter devastation to its foes.\n\nThough their origins are lost to the ages, Defilers were created sometime after the end of the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium on the orders of Abaddon the Despoiler to supplement the forces of the Traitor Legions, whose remaining Chaos Dreadnoughts were no longer the reliable heavy support units they had once been before their transformation into the insane cybernetic servants of the Ruinous Powers.\n\nDefilers are truly massive beasts of war, twice the size of most other Daemon Engines and with a temperament to match. The ground shivers and melts as they stalk towards their foes on six massive, segmented legs, their great pincer-arms twitching and snipping with an impatient need to slice through warm flesh.",

Pent-up Warp energy is channelled into their Excruciator Cannons, coalescing into hails of solid shot that rip through entire ranks of armoured foes with ease.\n\nWith their guns still screaming the Daemon Engines close ground on their victims, using their eviscerating claws to prise open vehicles and skewer those within. Soulflayer tendrils thrash frantically, mangling bodies and flensing them of their essence. As the Venomcrawlers continue to butcher, their fanged mouths gape ever wider, drawing the souls of those slain into their vast mechanical abdomens.\n\nVenomcrawlers are uniquely valued both off and on the battlefield. Not only can their repositories of stored Warp energy be siphoned in order to create fresh Daemon Engines, but they can be used in the thick of combat to weaken the fabric of reality. Masters of Possession are particularly adept at drawing upon this reservoir to lure the daemonic servants of the Chaos Gods into existence.

Abaddon intends to succeed where his predecessor Horus failed, breaking the Imperial Palace wide open and tearing the Emperor's rotting corpse from the Golden Throne.",

Master of the warband of piratical Chaos Space Marines called the Red Corsairs and Lord of the Maelstrom, he is the dark-souled king of an empire of monsters.\n\nDwelling within the swirling madness of the Maelstrom, Blackheart has slowly built an empire amongst the Renegades and Heretics of that great Warp rift that will soon rival the strength of the forces of Chaos that call the Eye of Terror home. Reaving into the Imperium at the head of a fleet of Renegades and Traitors, he has grown in power even as the light of the Imperium has grown dim and tattered.",

Mortarion and his Legion offered themselves up to the service of the Lord of Decay in return for their lives and the end of the constant suffering caused by the unnatural disease.\n\nTheir bodies became bloated and swollen with the corruption festering within them, but they no longer felt the agony of the Warp-pox and did not die from its horrific symptoms.\n\nSince then, many Heretic Astartes have dedicated themselves to Nurgle, though few achieve the vaunted ranks of the Death Guard. Those who truly wish to join this most foetid of cadres must first swear loyalty to the Primarch Mortarion -- only then will Nurgle bestow upon them the corrupting ague that created the Plague Marines.",

Amongst the countless diseases propagated by the Death Guard and Chaos Cults of Nurgle, none is more fearsome than Nurgle's Rot. This perfect plague is both spiritual and physical in nature, inflicting a drawn-out and horrific decline upon the victim that eventually erodes their soul, while leaving their body as a plague-ridden husk.\n\nVictims of the Walking Pox find their bodies rotting and shutting down until death eventually takes them. Yet this is not the end. The sufferer remains cruelly conscious and aware, unlike a zombie, trapped within their corpse as it reanimates with a rictus grin and staggers off in search of the living. Their flesh mutates even after death, sprouting bloated, pulsating tentacles and horn-like growths from their skulls similar to those of Nurgle's Daemonic Plaguebearers.\n\nSimply hearing the mindless, groaning cacophony of the Poxwalkers is enough to infect the souls of all but the most faithful Imperial citizens, leading to massed outbreaks even within fortresses and cities that appear inviolate.",

Some direct their fire at the Blightspawn, shots rebounding from his armour or thumping harmlessly through rotted flesh in sprays of effluence. The wise flee for their lives.\n\nWith a grunt of satisfaction, the Blightspawn deems his mixture ready, and raises the nozzle of his Plague Sprayer. A gurgling surge, a peristaltic urging, and a fountain of stinking slime engulfs the enemy. Flesh melts like wax. Armour bubbles and corrodes. Souls rot and bones crumble.\n\nAs the last of his targets devolve into infectious sludge, the Blightspawn chuckles and nods to himself, before lumbering on in search of fresh victims.",

Flesh wounds seal up with bulbous flab and clotted pus, while any damage serious enough to lay one of the Death Guard low is usually so catastrophic that no amount of suturing or surgery can save them. Instead, the Plague Surgeons tend to the well-being of the diseases that their brothers carry within their rotting bodies.\n\nAs a result, the very touch of a Plague Surgeon is virulently infectious, while every breath they exhale teems with spores, Warp-infused bacilli and Daemon motes. Any foe foolish enough to engage a Plague Surgeon in combat will soon be crawling with Empyric disease.\n\nPlague Surgeons bolster the potency of Nurgle's plagues in friend and foe alike.",

Part priests, part demagogues, part metaphysical scribes and quartermasters, these festering zealots stride to battle festooned with the trappings of their strange craft.

    "description": "The Daemon Primarch Mortarion himself perfected the designs for the first Plagueburst Crawlers as a labour of pure spite. The Death Lord sought to create a superlative mobile artillery piece that would outclass any comparative Imperial weapon, and thus demonstrate the Death Guard's superiority over their corpse-worshipping former kin.\n\nPlagueburst Crawlers are lumbering, formidable siege tanks whose huge ram-blades, thick armour plating and daemonic energies provide them with incredible resilience. Their fearsome Plagueburst Mortars boast a parabolic fire arc and terrifying range, while the shells they fire combine high-radius explosives with lethal clouds of corrosive spores to inflict damage comparable to that of Imperial Demolisher Cannons.\n\nMortarion's decision to make these vehicles Daemon Engines says much for his contempt for all living things. Live crew -- even Death Guard Heretic Astartes -- might be injured or slain or suffer an all-too-Human error of judgement in battle. By comparison, though great effort is required to bind a Daemon within each Plagueburst Crawler, once installed the possessor entities tirelessly obey their masters and, by extension, the will of Mortarion.",

He is a Champion of Chaos and the former first captain of the Death Guard Legion. Typhus is also the most feared of all Chaos Lords to command one of the legendary Plague Fleets.\n\nThat Typhus has been truly blessed by Nurgle is indisputable. When the Death Guard were adrift in the Warp during the Horus Heresy, dying from the Destroyer Plague, Calas Typhon, First Captain of the XIV Legion, absorbed the full power of the disease, becoming a vessel for this ultimate corruption. Swelling in size, his skin and armour bonded. Great pestilential funnels grew from his body, spewing forth a miasma of destruction. Calas Typhon has been transformed into Typhus, Host of the Destroyer Hive.\n\nWhen the Death Guard retreated to the Eye of Terror after the Horus Heresy, Typhus was disgusted by Mortarion's shaping of the Plague Planet in the image of their homeworld, Barbarus. Believing his master had given in to sentimentality, Typhus departed at the head of a sepsis cohort to spread Nurgle's gifts to the undeserving Imperium of Man.",

Lucius is also known as the \"Soulthief,\" \"Fulgrim's Champion,\" \"Blade of Aeons,\" and the \"Scion of Chemos.\"\n\nMany millennia ago, Lucius was a proud Space Marine of the Emperor's Children Legion, following his Primarch, Fulgrim, across the galaxy in the name of the Emperor. Forsaking all experience other than the art of close combat with the sword, Lucius bore the scars of battle with pride and, over time, he began to equate pain with success. By the time the Emperor's Children had been seduced by Horus' rebellion, Lucius had cut deep lines across his face, head and chest, linking his scars in a maze of irregular patterns that distorted and deformed his features. Lucius slowly descended into madness. He was compelled by the whispers in his mind to commit ever more extreme acts, furthering an intense obsession with being the perfect swordsman.\n\nLucius continued to distinguish himself in the service of his Primarch as the Third Legion descended into Chaos worship. He fought with incredible speed and skill in the gladiatorial contests Fulgrim held when the Legion was travelling from world to world. Lucius was almost invincible, a force of nature that could not be bested. The champion remained undefeated until he was finally slain fighting the infamous Lord Commander Cyrius.\n\nSlaanesh was loath to let such a promising protégé slip into oblivion. Over the next few solar weeks, the Artificer Armour Commander Cyrius wore began to warp and change. Cyrius' hair fell out in clumps, and dark lines appeared under his flesh, slowly pushing through his skin as a maze of scar tissue. Soon, Lucius had emerged completely. All that remained of his executioner was a screaming, writhing face, subsumed for eternity into Lucius' armour.\n\nNow, Lucius stalks the galaxy as an arrogant slaughterer who can never truly be killed. Whoever slays him and takes even a moment of satisfaction or pride from the act will find themselves transforming, slowly and painfully, into Lucius. The tortured visages of those who once killed him writhe within his armour, affording the swordsman endless gratification. His ornate sabre and sentient whip have tasted the blood of champions and kings across the galaxy, and he leads his debauched warband of Emperor's Children with total confidence, welcoming death with as much passion as he inflicts it upon his foes.",

The sorcerers and lords of the Thousand Sons use these Rubricae as bodyguards and enforcers.\n\nRubric Marines were created shortly after the Thousand Sons Legion fled to the Eye of Terror. Having dealt with sorcerous practices and energies for decades and now under the sway of Chaos, mutation ran wild within the Legion. In order to put an end to this warping process, a mighty spell called the Rubric of Ahriman was cast upon them. However, the powers unleashed reduced all Marines without psychic abilities to ash, sealing every clasp and joint of their armour and trapping their souls within.\n\nThese living suits are still capable of fighting and receiving orders from their masters, and with no fear and no will of their own, they make perfect bodyguards and guardians. Without an Aspiring Sorcerer to guide them, Rubric Marines tend to fall into inactivity; in combat, however, their battle-hunger returns and so they tend to move more like their former living selves.\n\nA single Sorcerer is capable of controlling a whole squad and will use his powers to enchant their bolters and turn their ammunition into explosive Inferno Bolts. These magical shots are able to ignore mundane armour and burn the souls of sentient beings.\n\nWhen a Rubric Marine dies, the dried remains of his material form pour from his rent armour and are scattered to all winds of the battlefield. After this, only the most powerful sorcerers could re-collect this dust, reseal the armour, and through a complicated ritual reanimate the Rubric Marine to a new \"life\". The sorcery required for this deed are very dangerous and just one syllable misspelled could drive the Sorcerer insane—or kill him outright.",

It is they who command the marching ranks of the Rubricae on the front lines and funnel screaming hordes of Chaos Cultists and Tzaangors towards the enemy.\n\nAs the insanity surrounding the sorcerer floods the battlefield, they intone rituals of summoning to draw Tzeentch's Daemonic children through the veil between realspace and the Immaterium. A sorcerer often has free rein to prosecute psychic warfare as they see fit, but their actions are ultimately in service to their sect, and to a more powerful Exalted Sorcerer or Daemon Prince.\n\nDespite their enthrallment, sorcerers are creatures of rampant ambition. As they serve their masters, they also seek ways to undermine them, drawing power from secret cabals and forging treacherous pacts with empyric entities. As a sorcerer grows in power, he risks succumbing to the weight of his own Warp energy—many fall to uncontrolled mutation and become polymorphic Chaos Spawn.\n\nYet their ambition drives them to take ever greater risks in the pursuit of power, for they hope one day to attain the rank of Exalted Sorcerer, and from there to become a blessed Daemon Prince of Tzeentch.\n\nOn occasion a powerful Warp-mage from another Chaos Traitor Legion will be guided by Tzeentch to seek out the Planet of the Sorcerers and pledge his existence to Magnus the Red. However, most of the Thousand Sons sorcerers arise from the ranks of the so-called Aspiring Sorcerers.\n\nThese under-mages are often created from the psykers of Tzeentchian Chaos Cults, who through profane demagoguery draw the attention of an invading Thousand Sons sect. They are taken to Tizca on the Planet of the Sorcerers, where they are subjected to ritual transformations to enhance their body and mind. Most are driven mad or are torn apart by the sudden influx of empyric energy; others die slow and agonising deaths as Warp-drenched augmentative gene-seed organs mutate the host body. But those few who survive are born anew as witch-warriors of the Thousand Sons.",

They go into battle at the behest of their Sorcerer Lords, advancing with eerie and unhurried calm.\n\nThe Scarab Occult's ornate armour—derived from a variant of ancient Tartaros Pattern war-plate—ripples with arcane force, sending solid shot ricocheting away and even turning aside the beams of high-technology weaponry. Each suit was a relic of the Legion, but even before their fall to Tzeentch was complete the Thousand Sons had begun engraving their Terminator Armour with profane inscriptions.\n\nThis desecration continued after the proscriptions against sorcery laid down by the Council of Nikaea, for the Scarab Occult saw it as their duty to guard the forbidden knowledge their Primarch had collected. The Rubric of Ahriman sealed each warrior inside his defiled armour permanently, locking the remnants of their souls for eternity with the idolatrous spell-words they had etched. Over millennia of exposure to the Warp, the true power of these etchings has blended with the essence of each warrior, creating in the Scarab Occult a hellishly twisted warrior cabal.\n\nThe Scarab Occult's armour has retained much of its potency over the long centuries since their creation. Refractor Field generators have become saturated with empyric energy, causing the air around them to writhe as incoming fire is deflected harmlessly. Each suit is also capable of withstanding the pressures of teleportation, allowing the warriors of the Scarab Occult to emerge suddenly onto the battlefield through holes torn in reality.\n\nThe ubiquitous weapon of the Scarab Occult Terminators is a cruelly curved blade based on the khopesh of ancient Prospero. The earliest khopeshes were forged from what scant pieces of precious metals could be found on the barren world and were symbols of authority used to mete out punishment to those who disobeyed Prosperine laws.",

    "description": "The Sekhmet were active throughout the era of the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. The Sekhmet were all Veteran members of the Scarab Occult of the XV Legion's elite 1st Fellowship, under the command of Captain Ahzek Ahriman, who was also the Magister Templi of the Legion's Corvidae Cult.\n\nThese proud and extremely devoted warriors were both combat Veterans and highly-ranked members of the psychic Cult system of the Thousand Sons. The Sekhmet were powerful warrior-mages and could call forth powers mortal men could never dream of wielding. On his own, each warrior of the Sekhmet was capable of subduing worlds. In battle, the Scarab Occult could simply conjure their Tutelaries into their enemies' hiding places and burn them out with invisible fires or crush them with psychic hammer blows. Methodical and swift, Ahriman's 1st Fellowship would then push onwards like autonomous engines of destruction.\n\nNone of the Sekhmet were ranked below the Thousand Sons Cult grade of Philosophus, the final Cult rank a warrior could hold before facing the Dominus Liminus. Each Astartes was able to mentally transcend his physical and emotional weaknesses; achieving a form of emotional purity that resulted in warriors who were both fearless and willing to follow orders immediately and unquestioningly.\n\nFollowing the Thousand Sons Legion's transformation into a Chaos Traitor Legion devoted to Tzeentch and the enactment of the Rubric of Ahriman, the physical bodies of the Sekhmet, like many of their non-psychic Battle-Brothers, were reduced to mere dust -- the animating spirit that remained possessing only an echo of their once-vaunted intellect. They go into battle at the behest of their Sorcerer Lords, advancing with eerie and unhurried calm.\n\nSome of these masters were part of the Scarab Occult at the time of Ahriman's mighty spell and were robust enough of spirit and mind to resist its obliterative effects. Others are powerful mystics who have ascended the ranks of the Thousand Sons over many centuries and through twisted ingenuity earned a place amongst the vaunted Sekhmet. In either case, a Scarab Occult Sorcerer controls a nigh-unstoppable force of warrior-automata, capable of wading unharmed through masses of lesser enemy infantry.",

These mass migrations follow lines of power that wind across the planet's crust, converging at sites where the roiling aetheric energy is at its thickest.\n\nAt these sites, they raise great flux-cairns -- megaliths inscribed with glyphs and runes and shaped in symbols sacred to Tzeentch -- which serve as repositories for the arcane knowledge stolen and despoiled by the Tzaangor tribes. The Shamans use these to channel Tzeentch's power throughout realspace by erecting duplicate monoliths in the jungles and barrens of other worlds.\n\nThe longer each simulacra remains in place, the more its warping influence bleeds into the planet on which it stands, transforming the world and preparing it for a full-scale invasion.",

Even the Sorcerers of the Thousand Sons respect these creatures, for their savagery is seen as one of Tzeentch's many esoteric tools.\n\nConstantly aware of the flow of causality, Enlightened can see where and when their strikes will cause the most damage. The divining spears some carry are tuned to predetermined victims, emitting humming reverberations that grow louder as they near their targets.\n\nOther Enlightened wield Fatecaster Greatbows, strung with ectoplasmic cords that send ensorcelled arrows on deadly paths.

As such they must strive tirelessly to maintain their position, subjugating those who covet their power through manipulation, deceit and open displays of force. In this way Exalted Sorcerers gather beneath them many thralls – lesser Sorcerers who serve the wiles of their master.

Ahzek Ahriman was once the Chief Librarian and first captain of the ancient Thousand Sons Legion.\n\nAhriman has always sought to better comprehend the nature of his patron Chaos God Tzeentch and of the force of Chaos itself and gain the unrivalled power such knowledge will bring.\n\nHis action in crafting the Rubric of Ahriman, perhaps one of the greatest works of sorcery in history, would ultimately result in his banishment from the Legion he had hoped to safeguard. It is his intense need to find a way to undo the effects of the Rubric upon his beloved Thousand Sons that first drove Ahriman on his quest to seek out the deepest knowledge of Chaos. He remains a wanderer across the galaxy, forever searching for any knowledge that will allow him to finally grasp the greatest of all enigmas in the universe -- the true nature of Tzeentch himself.\n\nAcross a thousand worlds, Ahriman has sought the keys to save what he has already destroyed through his own hubris among the Thousand Sons. The scars of this obsession found across the galaxy have made his name a curse in the mouths of Humans and aliens alike. Scraps of arcane lore, artefacts both obscure and profane, and rare but psychically powerful souls draw him like a raven to a corpse.\n\nAhriman refuses to acknowledge either Tzeentch or Chaos itself as his master. Across the ensuing millennia he has become a scourge of the Imperium, raiding ancient museums, librariums, scholaria and reclusia, places of learning, religion and contemplative thought. He seeks to acquire artefacts, data, or even persons he believes can lead him to fully master the way of the sorcerer.",

Magnus thought he would be able to control the \"Great Ocean\" of psychic energy that was the Warp; however, his prodigious and careless application of his psychic gifts eventually caused him to fall out of favour with his father, the Emperor of Mankind, as well as with the majority of his brother primarchs. His psychic immaturity, recklessness, selfish pride and arrogance also caused his own undoing, as it eventually brought about his own damnation and eternal servitude to the Dark God of Change, Tzeentch.\n\nIn the end, Magnus led his XVth Legion to the banner of Horus and fought on the Arch-heretic's side during the Great Betrayal of the Horus Heresy. He survived those events and ascended to the position of a Daemon Primarch of Tzeentch as a reward for his service to the Changer of Ways.\n\nMagnus has spent the majority of the ten Terran millennia since the end of the Horus Heresy ensconced atop his tower upon Sortiarius, the Planet of the Sorcerers within the Eye of Terror, planning the ultimate destruction of the Imperium he believes betrayed him and his Legion.",

It takes a warrior of supreme skill and confidence to command them -- a warrior like the Chaos Lord Invocatus of the World Eaters Traitor Legion.\n\nFrom atop his Juggernaut he leads thunderous charges of Bloodcrushers and Berzerkers in frontal attacks that light the sky aflame, and some claim he even rides the flames themselves.\n\nAt an unknown date in the Era Indomitus, the Deathwatch Watch Fortress of Ebon Vale was assailed by the gore-slicked World Eaters warband of Heretic Astartes commanded by Lord Invocatus. Together with Daemon Engine allies from the Brazen Beasts, Invocatus raided the arsenals of the Deathwatch to claim state-of-the-art Adeptus Astartes wargear and powerful artefacts of battle from Ebon Vale's reliquaries.\n\nWhen the Chaos attack was quarantined and whittled down by the Deathwatch's air cover, the World Eaters made their departure, leaving empty weapons vaults and hundreds of black-armoured corpses in their wake. With the Deathwatch greatly reduced in strength in the region, a Hrud infestation spread throughout the Ebon Vale soon after, reducing several Civilised Worlds to useless mulch.",

He currently leads his own World Eaters warband called the Butcherhorde.\n\nSecond only to the World Eaters Daemon Primarch Angron in aggression and bloodlust, Kharn has lived a life of murder and betrayal, the blood spilt and skulls collected for his patron beyond counting.\n\nIn battle Kharn is always where the fighting is at its thickest, wielding his heavy chainaxe Gorechild (which, along with its twin Gorefather, was wielded by Angron during the Horus Heresy). Rimmed with the unbreakable teeth of a Mica Dragon, this fell weapon continually rises and falls as it severs heads and claims skulls. He is the avatar of Khorne, embodying the Blood God's indiscriminate rage and bloodlust in the realm of mortals.\n\nLike his World Eaters comrades, he emerged from the gruesome psycho-surgery experiments of Angron, having underwent ritual lobotomization with the implantation of the Butcher's Nails cranial implants, with all sense of fear and danger removed so that the rush he experienced in combat was greatly enhanced. His love of murder was so great that Kharn actually had an ancient death-counter installed in his helmet which registers the number of kills he has made in the helm's eye lenses.\n\nKharn has dedicated his millennia-long existence to unleashing bloody carnage upon anyone and anything within reach. He is drawn by the scent of war as a hungering hound is drawn by fresh meat, and it has become impossible to tally his slaying. Even during the Great Crusade, when he fought in the vanguard of the World Eaters Legion's assault companies, Kharn was known to be a brilliant warrior.\n\nKharn the Betrayer will never stop killing. Whether it is the blood madness he learnt from Angron during the Horus Heresy, or the Chaos taint that has corrupted his soul since Khorne's gaze fell upon him, Kharn's mind burns with an unquenchable rage. So long as he draws breath he will offer up lives to the Blood God, until at last he gives his own.",
